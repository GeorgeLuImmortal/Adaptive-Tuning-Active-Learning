"gastroesophageal reflux disease: diagnosis and management. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a chronic, relapsing condition with associated morbidity and an adverse impact on quality of life. the disease is common, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of to percent in the u.s. population. gerd can usually be diagnosed based on the clinical presentation alone. in some patients, however, the diagnosis may require endoscopy and, rarely, ambulatory ph monitoring. management includes lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy; refractory disease requires surgery. the therapeutic goals are to control symptoms, heal esophagitis and maintain remission so that morbidity is decreased and quality of life is improved."
"diseases and problems secondary to massive obesity. morbid obesity is a health hazard. it carries several health risks and decreases life expectancy. individuals with morbid obesity may develop one or more complications. these are mainly cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, genitourinary and gynaecological. patients with morbid obesity also have a high surgical risk. this review analyses the most common complications of morbidly obese patients and their changes after surgically induced weight loss."
"basal and stimulated gastrin and pepsinogen levels after eradication of helicobacter pylori: a -year follow-up study. a decrease in gastrin and pepsinogen (pg) levels month after helicobacter pylori eradication has been described repeatedly, but the long-term progression of such a decrease has been scarcely studied. we therefore studied the effect of h. pylori eradication on basal and stimulated gastrin and pg levels for year. initially, the usefulness of measuring these parameters for the noninvasive diagnosis of h. pylori eradication was validated. furthermore, an assessment was made of the association between h. pylori reinfection and a re-increase in gastrin and pg values. finally, an evaluation was made of the variables influencing gastrin and pg concentration, with particular attention to h. pylori infection and histological lesions of gastric mucosa."

"omeprazole: a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of its use in duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. omeprazole regulates gastric acid secretion and is an effective treatment of acute duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis, achieving more rapid healing and symptomatic relief than histamine h -receptor antagonists. when administered as maintenance therapy, omeprazole reduces the incidence of relapse. the drug is also highly effective in patients poorly responsive to histamine h -receptor antagonists. the daily acquisition cost of omeprazole is higher than that of histamine h -receptor antagonists in many countries, and thus it is important to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of omeprazole in the short and long term treatment of duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. pharmacoeconomic analyses have been performed in several clinical settings using pooled data from clinical trials or simulated models of clinical practice. in a single analysis using finnish cost data, omeprazole was more cost effective than ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer disease over a -month period. the cost effectiveness of omeprazole was comparable to that of sucralfate-containing regimens, with patients receiving omeprazole being healed more quickly and experiencing a greater number of healthy days. using a computer-model simulation and swedish cost data, omeprazole was more cost effective than ranitidine when administered as intermittent treatment of duodenal ulcer over years. preliminary reports indicate that regimens which eradicate helicobacter pylori are more cost effective than those which do not. as short term treatment of reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole to mg/day was the dominating treatment strategy, being less costly and more effective than ranitidine to mg/day. omeprazole mg/day produced symptom-free days more cost effectively than either cimetidine . g/day or ranitidine mg/day. more importantly, as long term (maintenance or intermittent) treatment of reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole mg/day was more cost effective than both ranitidine mg twice daily and 'phase ' therapy (diet and antacids) over and months. thus, based on analyses evaluated, omeprazole appears to be more cost effective than ranitidine in the short term treatment of duodenal ulcer. results for long term treatment are less clear cut, but full details from some studies are not yet available. for the short term treatment of reflux oesophagitis omeprazole is more cost effective than ranitidine or cimetidine and for long term treatment omeprazole is more cost effective than ranitidine. as treatment for reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole is considered to be the dominating treatment strategy."
"cost and quality effects of treating erosive oesophagitis. a re-evaluation. the objective of this study was to re-evaluate the clinical and economic effects of common therapies for erosive oesophagitis in the light of a newly approved treatment regimen. a previously constructed -month community practice decision analytical model was revised to include the latest published data on efficacy and symptomatic outcomes. the original results of phase i therapy (antacids plus dietary, sleeping and lifestyle changes) alone or combined with ranitidine mg bid or omeprazole mg od were reassessed by adding new clinical data on the efficacy of and symptomatic response to ranitidine mg qid. the same payment data used in the first analysis were applied here as well, with the addition of the us price of ranitidine mg qid. the study perspective was that of the payer or insurer. omeprazole-based therapy remained a dominant strategy for symptomatic care during the -month model. it was % less costly per patient, led to % fewer symptomatic months, and had % lower cost per symptom-free month than ranitidine mg qid, the next best alternative. evolving treatment strategies necessitate rapid assessment and reassessment so that clinical practice can remain current, patients can be assured of the best quality, and insurers can be aware of treatment cost and budgetary impact given limited resources in all countries. only by consistent and continuous re-evaluation of new or changing medical interventions can clinicians and insurers adapt patient management to new scientifically derived results. this is the best manner by which to meet patients' care needs and the clinical needs of practitioners, as well as the financial needs of payers."
"the cost effectiveness of helicobacter pylori eradication versus maintenance and episodic treatment in duodenal ulcer patients in sweden. this study compares the cost effectiveness of helicobacter pylori eradication and conventional treatment in duodenal ulcer patients treated by a general practitioner. using a markov chain approach, swedish cost data and a study period of years, we conclude that h. pylori eradication with omeprazole and appropriate antibiotics is a cost-effective alternative compared with both maintenance and episodic treatment. of the patients entering the eradication strategy, most are cured and will have no relapse during a -year period. h. pylori eradication results in higher initial costs but, because of a very low risk of recurrence after successful eradication, the expected future costs are reduced. the investment pays off within year when compared with maintenance treatment, and within years when compared with episodic treatment."
"cost-effectiveness analysis of different strategies for treating duodenal ulcer. helicobacter pylori eradication versus antisecretory treatment. helicobacter pylori has recently been recognised as a causative agent for duodenal ulcer, and the efficacy of various combinations of antibacterials and antisecretory agents in eradicating this pathogen has been assessed. the objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of treatment strategies for patients with h. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. cost effectiveness was analysed for antisecretory therapy (omeprazole mg/day for weeks), and eradication therapy (triple therapy: omeprazole mg/day plus clarithromycin g/day plus amoxicillin g/day for week). in a markov model, a hypothetical cohort of patients was followed for years through disease states. cyclic eradication therapy (i.e. in the first duodenal ulcer episode and in relapses) was the most cost effective [ spanish pesetas (pta) per day free of symptoms (dfs); pta = $us (october )] of the eradication options evaluated [antisecretory in the first episode, then eradication for relapses (pta./dfs), and eradication therapy first, then antisecretory therapy (pta./dfs)]. antisecretory therapy alone was less cost-effective (pta/dfs) than each of the eradication options. eradication treatment in the first episode of duodenal ulcer and relapses has savings in direct costs per patient of up to % compared with antisecretory therapy alone. sensitivity analyses showed the model to be very robust. it is, therefore, advisable to treat initial episodes of h. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer and relapses with triple therapy. the improved cost-effectiveness ratio was largely explained by the long term reduction in relapses obtained with the eradication strategies."
"prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastropathy: clinical and economic implications of a single-tablet formulation of diclofenac/misoprostol. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are commonly used to manage arthritis. while controlling symptoms and improving quality of life, nsaid use is associated with gastroduodenal injury and a %-% annual risk for symptomatic gastroduodenal ulceration, hemorrhage, and perforation. this requires clinicians to balance the efficacy of nsaids against the potential risk of serious gastrointestinal events. identification and stratification of risk can help guide the optimal approach for arthritis management of individual patients or large populations such as managed care organizations. nsaid-induced gastroenteropathy carries considerable economic consequences; % of arthritis costs are related to managing serious adverse events. it is reasonable to assume that these costs may not be incurred if high-risk patients are recognized and optimally managed. newer therapies with proven safety margins present an attractive option, especially for patients at higher risk. the single-tablet formulations of diclofenac and misoprostol (arthrotec) offer an alternative in managing nsaid patients because of their inherent safety profile. studies with diclofenac/misoprostol indicate its effectiveness in treating signs and symptoms of arthritis and in reducing the incidence of nsaid-induced gastroenteropathy. as such, this agent may provide improved medical and economic outcomes. this review discusses the clinical aspects of nsaid-induced gastroenteropathy, including available preventive therapies. approaches to assessing patients' risk for developing complications, and the relationship of medical risk and economic outcomes, are also examined. although not all patients require preventive therapy, patients with heightened risk may benefit clinically and economically from gastroprotective nsaids. additional research or modeling may provide further insight into the economic implications of managing and preventing nsaid-induced gastroenteropathy."

"quality of life in arthritis patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. arthritis is a painful and disabling condition. to suppress the pain and the inflammatory process, patients are often chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) users. chronic use of nsaids may induce peptic ulcer, dyspeptic problems and heartburn. therefore, these patients are often provided with treatment to relieve and/or protect against gastrointestinal problems. rheumatic disorders also affect a range of health-related quality of life domains. in one study, patients with nsaid-associated gastroduodenal lesions complained about lack of energy, sleep disturbances, emotional distress and social isolation in addition to pain and mobility limitations. the degree of distress and dysfunction differed markedly from scores in an unselected population. clinical trial data suggest that acid-suppressing therapy with omeprazole is superior to therapy with misoprostol and ranitidine in healing gastroduodenal lesions and preventing abdominal pain, heartburn and indigestion symptoms during continued nsaid treatment. because arthritic patients are severely incapacitated by their condition regarding most aspects of health-related quality of life, it is important to offer a treatment that is effective in healing and preventing nsaid-induced ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms during continued nsaid treatment without further compromising the patients' quality of life. treatment with omeprazole once daily has been shown to be superior to that with ranitidine and misoprostol in this respect."

"importance of ph control in the management of gerd. the degree of esophageal mucosal injury that occurs in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease depends on duration of exposure and ph of the refluxate. evidence suggests that an intraesophageal ph of less than . directly correlates with the degree of mucosal injury. the advent of acid secretory inhibitors such as the histamine-receptor antagonists (hras) and, more recently, the proton pump inhibitors (ppis) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with reflux disease. however, the evidence linking the degree of mucosal damage to ph of the refluxate has prompted investigators to reevaluate the effectiveness of these agents. the ppis are significantly more effective than the hras in achieving and sustaining an intragastric ph above .. the results of clinical trials performed with the ppis indicate a faster rate of healing of erosive esophagitis and of symptom relief than treatment with hras."
"discontinuation rates of helicobacter pylori treatment regimens: a meta-analysis. we conducted a meta-analysis to determine what factors in treatment regimens for helicobacter pylori are associated with increased discontinuation rates. studies were selected from the - medline data base, and references in published articles and reviews were obtained. each article was uniformally abstracted for factors that could potentially affect dropout rates. drug regimens with high numbers of doses per day had highest dropout rates (p=.). the total dropout rate was lowest for regimens containing a proton pump inhibitor (or = ., ci ., .). the rate was high in regimens containing a bismuth compound due to side effects (or = ., ci ., .). the main finding was that drug regimens for eradication of h. pylori that have a high number of doses per day result in higher discontinuation rates than regimens with fewer doses per day."

"the efficacy of extended-interval dosing of omeprazole in keeping gastroesophageal reflux disease patients symptom free. the potential economic advantage of alternate-day therapy for gerd maintenance must be weighed against the potential cost of failure before it can be widely instituted. the studies presented have helped develop a clinical picture of the patients who may benefit from alternate-day therapy without risk of complications or potential increases in management costs. bank et al., reporting on a group of patients, found that patients with grade ii-iv disease had a % success rate at two to eight years. bank defined success as both maintenance of endoscopic healing and symptom control. ladas et al. found a .% success rate defined as clinical and endoscopic remission in grades ii-iii disease. kurucar et al. monitored symptom control and esophageal complications in his patients and found the regimen to have a % success rate in grades iii-iv disease. lind et al. found that % of patients could remain symptom free with on-demand therapy if they were endoscopy-negative at baseline. the results of the mantides et al. study are important because they imply that alternate-day omeprazole therapy may be more effective than alternatives for step-down treatment, such as ranitidine or cisapride. furthermore, patients can be educated to increase their frequency of use if symptoms should arise. not only does this give the patient a sense of self-empowerment over his or her disease state, but it avoids the cost of switching to a ppi due to failure with an hra or a motility agent. alternate-day use of omeprazole should be attempted only during the maintenance phase of gerd therapy. patients requiring > mg/d to achieve healing appeared to be poor candidates for alternate-day omeprazole maintenance therapy. based on available studies, it would seem that patients with grades -ii gerd would benefit most from alternate-day therapy. a role for alternate-day therapy in grades iii-iv is apparent from the results presented but requires greater caution in view of the differing success rates (-%) in various studies. with grades ii-iii esophagitis, a mean -hour gastric ph > and a gastric ph < less than % of the time during the initial healing phase with omeprazole mg/d appeared to be associated with success on alternate-day therapy. evidence that all marketed ppis have similar success is not available and should not be extrapolated from the data presented. evidence that downward dosage adjustments of ppis versus extending dosage intervals are effective in the maintenance of gerd should be recognized. lansoprazole has been approved for treating erosive esophagitis at mg/d, with the maintenance dose established at mg/d. studies showing that lansoprazole mg/d is more effective than alternate-day therapy with lansoprazole mg exist, although similar studies with omeprazole have not been performed. the abstracts describing the use of alternate-day omeprazole accounted for all enrollees and included endoscopic grading or ph monitoring to document disease severity at baseline. most also included these same objective measures as end points in combination with symptom control. this strengthens the data since the positive predictive value of typical symptoms is variable. however, there are also several significant limitations. abstracts provide only limited information on methods. all studies other than lind et al. lacked randomization. this study was also the only one that blinded patients to their treatment. sample sizes for the majority of the trials were quite small. statistical analyses were not performed on any of the trial results with the exception of the trial by lind et al. in light of the lack of evidence of statistical significance as well as study design flaws, conclusions should be drawn cautiously. larger well-designed trials looking at both the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternate day omeprazole are required before a definitive recommendation can be made."

"prophylaxis and treatment of nsaid-induced gastroduodenal disorders. a significant percentage of patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) experience some type of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, lesions of the gastroduodenal tract being clinically the most relevant. nsaids cause gastrointestinal damage by independent mechanisms: a topical effect, which is ph and pka related, and a systemic effect mediated by cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibition with a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. using endoscopy, gastroduodenal lesions identified include subepithelial haemorrhages, erosions and ulcers. the prevalence of ulceration in nsaid users has been reported as being between and % with a -fold higher frequency of gastric ulcers compared with duodenal ulcers. among the strategies used to decrease the risk of ulcer development are: (i) the use of analgesics other than nsaids; (ii) use of the lowest possible dosage of nsaid; (iii) the use of a cox- selective nsaid; (iv) the use of low doses of corticosteroids instead of nsaids; (v) avoidance of concomitant use of nsaids and corticosteroids; and (vi) use of preventive therapy. in an attempt to reduce the incidence of nsaid-induced gastrointestinal lesions, the following approaches have been proposed: (i) use of the prostaglandin analogue misoprostol, which is an antiulcer drug which has been proven to be as effective in the prevention of nsaid-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers as in the reduction of serious upper gastrointestinal complications; (ii) histamine h receptor antagonists (h antagonists), e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine and famotidine, which are useful in the prevention of nsaid-induced duodenal ulcers during long term treatment, but not in the prevention of nsaid-induced gastric ulcers; (iii) proton pump inhibitors, e.g omeprazole, and pantoprazole, whose efficacy in preventing nsaid-associated ulcers has been recently demonstrated; and (iv) barrier agents, e.g. sucralfate, which cannot be recommended as prophylactic agents to prevent nsaid-induced gastropathy. the first step in the treatment of nsaid-associated ulcers lies in a reduction in the dosage of the nsaid or discontinuation of the drug. if nsaid treatment cannot be withdrawn, a proton pump inhibitor appears to be the most effective treatment in healing ulcers, accelerating the slow healing observed with h antagonists."

"relative efficacies of gastric proton pump inhibitors: their clinical and pharmacological basis. the present review will verify by intra-study rank orders, and their comparison between studies, that the different gastric proton pump inhibitors (ppis) display similar dose-response relationships with similar potencies and efficacies on a milligram basis, i.e., at the same milligram doses. this is in line with their basic pharmacology which suggests that, primarily, the serum aucs of the free pro-drugs and their chemical activation half lives at ph relative to their serum elimination half lives determine the efficacies of ppis. according to the literature, these drug characteristics are similar for all ppis. although ppis have been introduced into the therapy of acute peptic ulcer disease at different daily, oral doses of mg (omeprazole and rabeprazole), mg (lansoprazole) and mg (pantoprazole), the data suggest that the optimal dose of lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole, with respect to the acute treatment of peptic ulcers and moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), is about - mg daily. the data base of rabeprazole appears to be too small at present to make any definite statement. lower daily doses of the ppis of about - mg are sufficient in less severe cases of gerd and in maintenance therapy. it appears that different dose recommendations were based on different strategies to balance optimal drug dosage and safety, rather than on real differences in milligram-related efficacies."

"rabeprazole: a review of its use in acid-related gastrointestinal disorders. rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump. it causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion and has a more rapid onset of action than omeprazole. duodenal ulcers healed faster after treatment with rabeprazole or mg/day than placebo or ranitidine mg times daily and at a generally similar rate to omeprazole mg/day in patients with duodenal ulcers; rabeprazole was similar or superior to these agents in relieving symptoms. rabeprazole and mg/day healed gastric ulcers faster than placebo, and rabeprazole mg/day healed ulcers at a similar healing rate, to omeprazole mg/day in well controlled -week studies. gastric ulcer symptom relief with rabeprazole was similar or superior to that provided by omeprazole or placebo. in -week studies in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gerd), rabeprazole , and mg/day were more effective than placebo, rabeprazole mg/day was more effective than ranitidine mg twice daily, and rabeprazole mg/day was similar in efficacy to omeprazole mg/day. symptom relief with rabeprazole in -week trials in patients with gerd was superior to that provided by placebo, and similar to ranitidine or omeprazole. rabeprazole was similar to omeprazole and superior to placebo in both maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed gerd in -year studies. one-week triple therapy with rabeprazole mg twice daily plus antibacterial agents achieved > or = % helicobacter pylori eradication, but, as would be expected, a regimen of rabeprazole mg twice daily plus antibacterial agent was less successful. the drug was as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole as part of triple therapy for h. pylori eradication. rabeprazole successfully reduced acid output to target levels and prevented further pathological changes in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome. usual dosages of rabeprazole are mg/day for weeks to treat duodenal ulcers, weeks for gastric ulcers and weeks for gerd, although some patients with duodenal ulcer may respond to a mg/day dosage. for long term maintenance of gerd healing, or mg daily doses are adequate. patients with hypersecretory states may need individualised dosages starting at mg/day. the drug was well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, rash, infection, diarrhoea and flu syndrome as the most common adverse events. in conclusion, rabeprazole appears to be a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and a low potential for drug interactions. the drug may be used to achieve healing and the relief of symptoms of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and gerd, maintain gerd healing, and can form part of effective regimens to eradicate h. pylori."

"prevention of the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the role of proton pump inhibitors. the associations between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and the presence and complications of gastroduodenal erosions and ulcers are well established. evidence that acid aggravates nsaid-induced injury provides a rationale for minimising such damage by acid suppression. other strategies discussed include avoidance of nsaids or minimising their dosage, selecting nsaids known to cause less damage, and co-prescription of various agents. cytoprotection with misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue, has been shown to be effective in reducing nsaid-related peptic ulcers and their complications. unfortunately, adverse effects may limit compliance in some patients. histamine h antagonists have only limited efficacy in the prevention of nsaid-induced ulcers in humans, particularly in the stomach, except at higher than standard dosages. this may relate to their relatively modest effect in elevating gastric ph, especially in comparison with proton pump inhibitors. several studies now confirm the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the short and longer term prevention of nsaid-induced upper gastrointestinal injury. placebo-controlled studies suggest reductions of over % in gastric and duodenal ulcer rates over to months. the recent astronaut (acid suppression trial: ranitidine versus omeprazole for nsaid-associated ulcer treatment) study documented the greater prophylactic efficacy of omeprazole over ranitidine at standard dosages for months. the omnium (omeprazole versus misoprostol for nsaid-induced ulcer management) study showed omeprazole to be slightly more effective overall than misoprostol in preventing the upper gastrointestinal adverse effects of nsaids, with both substantially more effective than placebo, although misoprostol was somewhat less well tolerated. although substantial reductions in nsaid ulceration are now achievable when co-therapy with a proton pump inhibitor is given, a few patients will still develop ulcers and their complications. hence the judicious use of nsaids in the first instance cannot be overemphasised."

"non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and gastro-intestinal toxicity: current issues. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are among the most widely used drugs and their widespread use is associated with increased gastro-intestinal toxic effects such as ulceration, haemorrhage, perforation and death. they result in these complications mainly by reducing cytoprotective prostaglandins (pge and pgi) in the stomach, through the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (cox) enzyme. the increased morbidity and mortality, in addition to enormous cost, associated with nsaid-associated side effects, necessitates a need for safer gi-friendly nsaid. various approaches have been used to counteract nsaid associated side effects with varying degrees of success and acceptance. these include the use of alternative analgesia, anti-acid secretory agents like proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and prostaglandin analogues. in addition, new types of nsaids are being developed, based on new understanding of their mechanism of action and the pathogenesis of inflammation. these include a new class of nsaids called ""selective cox- inhibitors"". these agents preserve the cox- that is responsible for the production of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the stomach and selectively inhibit cox- induced at the sites of inflammation. selective cox- inhibitors exert the same analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as the existing nsaids but may be less toxic to the stomach. in this review the background development and well-structured clinical trials on this new generation nsaids are discussed."

"treatments of peptic ulcer. from the late th century, mount sinai gastroenterologists declared their scepticism of the efficacy of all recommended treatments of peptic ulcer, and looked forward to trials which could distinguish between sequence and consequence, between association and causation. the rationale of all the early studies was to reduce gastric acidity, but it soon became clear that any neutralization by single doses of antacids was brief and ineffective. winkelstein s demonstration that patients with duodenal ulcer had higher acidities not only before and after meals but also through the night hours led him to introduce a new treatment, the alkalinized intragastric milk drip together with atropine. one of the earliest controlled clinical trials at mount sinai compared different antacid regimes and showed that ph values above . were achieved in only about half of the patients on the various drips. when the new anticholinergic drugs were developed in the s, they were found to produce sustained hypoacidity and were tried as maintenance treatment, as an alternative to acid-lowering operations. the third mount sinai approach was to attack the machinery of the acid-producing cell itself by an inhibitor of the enzyme producing hydrogen ions. in , this enzyme had been thought to be carbonic anhydrase, but when janowitz and hollander tested its inhibitor, acetazolamide, and showed marked but very brief acid inhibition, they concluded that its action was too brief to be therapeutically useful. the problem was to be solved decades later by h receptor blockers from britain and h+k+atpase inhibitors from sweden."

"reflux disease and barrett's esophagus. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is still an important clinical problem. continuing efforts are being made to establish a classification of the condition that would allow improved communications for both clinical and research purposes. in medical treatment, the trends are toward proton-pump inhibitor therapy at all stages of gerd, calling into question the role of endoscopy for tailoring individual therapy. arguments against the use of h. pylori eradication therapy in gerd have gained importance. surgeons are continuing to report excellent results with fundoplication, but careful studies are needed to prove whether antireflux surgery is really capable of saving costs, as its proponents claim. barrett's esophagus is still a topic of lively interest. since there is no method of primary prevention, endoscopy has a crucial role in detecting affected patients and guiding them toward one of the various surveillance strategies--which are not yet clearly established. the debate over short-segment barrett's esophagus, and especially over ""microscopic"" barrett's esophagus (at the squamocolumnar junction), has not yet been resolved. however, there is now less doubt that gerd is a condition associated with a substantially higher risk for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. given this risk of malignant transformation, there is continuing competition between different ablation techniques; however, careful data from much larger populations will be needed before ablation reaches the stage of broad clinical application. until specific guidelines become available, patients with barrett's esophagus should receive endoscopic follow-up until it can be ascertained which individuals are at risk for cancer and require ablation of barrett's mucosa."
"ulcers and gastritis. once again this year, developments in the field of ulcers and gastritis have been entirely dominated by findings relating to helicobacter pylori. however, interest in h. pylori can be expected to decline, since the prevalence of the infection is rapidly decreasing in the developing world - to the point that many gastroduodenal ulcers are now unrelated to h. pylori a further reason for declining interest is disappointment regarding the role of h. pylori in dyspepsia. the expected reduction in the endoscopic workload produced by screening for h. pylori or caga positivity has so far not occurred. the exact role of the damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in h. pylori-infected stomachs remains controversial. equally controversial is the magnitude of the increased reflux symptomatology and reflux disease observed after h. pylori infection has been cured in patients with ulcer disease. eradication therapy is largely dominated by proton-pump inhibitor triple therapies, although the efficacy of these is declining. bismuth triple therapy and quadruple therapy continue to be valid alternatives."
"pantoprazole versus omeprazole in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. pantoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor with a potent antisecretory activity, well defined pharmacokinetics and safety profile. the aim of this single blind, randomized clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of pantoprazole (pan) mg/day and omeprazole (ome) mg/day in patients with grade i and ii gerd (savary-miller classification). a total of patients were included (pan = and ome = ). in the per protocol/analysis, healing rates at weeks were .% pan and .% ome (ns), and at weeks .% pan and .% ome (ns). in the intention to treat analysis, healing rates at weeks were % pan and % ome (ns), and at weeks % pan and .% ome (ns). both pantoprazole and omeprazole were well tolerated with no serious drug related adverse events. pantoprazole mg/day was found to be safe and effective therapy comparable to omeprazole mg/day in the short-term treatment for reflux esophagitis (grade i and ii)."

"pharmacokinetic considerations in the eradication of helicobacter pylori. as helicobacter pylori plays an important role in the aetiopathogenesis of peptic ulcer, therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining long term remission have shifted from the control of intragastric ph to targeting h. pylori. according to recent international guidelines the clinical goals--rapid ulcer healing and prevention of relapse--can be best accomplished by combination therapy consisting of an antisecretory drug (proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine) and antimicrobial agents (preferable amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole). when applying such multidrug regimens, possible synergy between the agents suggests that pharmacokinetic considerations might help to improve h. pylori eradication rates, which should be above to % on an intention-to-treat basis. the present review summarises the pharmacokinetic properties and interaction potential of all drugs presently used in the various h. pylori eradication regimens, with emphasis on particular patient populations such as the elderly and those with renal impairment. the drugs considered are omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine and ranitidine bismutrex, bismuth salts, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin, metronidazole, tinidazole and tetracycline. when addressing the clinically important questions of the efficacy, safety and costs of the recommended regimens, the impact of drug disposition on h. pylori eradication should not be neglected."

"from bench to bedside to bug: an update of clinically relevant advances in the care of persons with helicobacter pylori- associated diseases. in-depth meetings of the xith international workshop on gastroduodenal pathology and helicobacter pylori led to the presentation and discussion of extensive new data on h. pylori and its diseases. the mode of transmission of h. pylori remains unclear, and it remains unknown why only a small proportion of infected individuals develop duodenal or gastric ulcer disease and even fewer develop gastric cancer. the role of h. pylori eradication in persons with uninvestigated dyspepsia remains controversial. new clinical trials of h. pylori treatment show symptom relief and improvement in the quality of life of persons with functional dyspepsia, especially in those with ulcer-like or reflux-like dyspepsia. clearly the move is toward symptom-based management of persons with dyspepsia, with fewer endoscopies being needed in the otherwise healthy young dyspeptic patients. it remains controversial whether eradicating h. pylori in duodenal ulcer or functional dyspepsia increases the risk of subsequent development of gastroesophageal reflux disease. the one-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens remain the gold standard of h. pylori therapy, but some of the ranitidine bismuth citrate plus two antibiotic regimens also achieve an % h. pylori eradication rate on an intention-to-treat basis. while the urea breath test remains the noninvasive test of choice, interesting new data are available on the use of stool antigen testing to diagnose h. pylori infection. the number of h pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases grows to include possible liver, vascular, immune and skin conditions."

"helicobacter pylori-negative peptic ulcers: frequency and implications for management. most patients with peptic ulcers are infected with helicobacter pylori, but the infection may not be responsible for the ulcer. it is increasingly recognized that different causes of ulcers coexist in a given patient, confounding determination of the exact cause of the ulcer. for example, in infected patients with ulcers who also are using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), it is not possible to establish the ulcer's cause. moreover, recent studies in the united states in infected patients with duodenal ulcers who were treated with various regimens to prove their efficacy in eradicating h. pylori and preventing ulcer recurrence found that approximately % of patients suffered an ulcer recurrence despite successful h. pylori eradication. the infection clearly did not cause their ulcers but was originally thought to have done so. thus, as many as one-fifth of patients with ulcers may have the cause falsely attributed to h. pylori infection. when this number is added to that of ulcer patients who are h. pylori-negative upon original presentation--at least % in other recent u.s. studies--it is evident that the proportion of non-h. pylori ulcer patients is larger than originally believed. this proportion is likely to increase with the declining incidence of h. pylori infection. other causes of ulcers include the use of aspirin and nsaids (which may be surreptitious), hypersecretory states, crohn's disease, and patients with ""idiopathic"" ulcers. patients with ""idiopathic"" ulcers are characterized by postprandial hypersecretion of acid and hypergastrinemia with accelerated gastric emptying. h. pylori ulcers may be difficult to manage because antisecretory drugs are less effective in inhibiting gastric acidity in the absence of h. pylori infection."

"parietal cell protrusions and fundic gland cysts during omeprazole maintenance treatment. parietal cell protrusion (pcp), swelling and bulging of parietal cells, has been observed in the oxyntic mucosa of patients receiving omeprazole. the frequency of this event and the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. as such, it is unknown whether there is a relation with either serum gastrin or helicobacter pylori infection, and whether pcp predisposes to the development of fundic gland cysts (fgc). we therefore investigated the development of pcp and fgc in gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) patients treated with omeprazole and correlated findings to duration of therapy, gastrin, and h pylori infection. in a randomized, double-blinded study, gerd patients were evaluated by endoscopy with biopsy sampling for histology and culture at baseline, and after and months' therapy with omeprazole mg daily. h pylori-positive patients were randomized to additional eradication therapy or placebo antibiotics at baseline. all histological slides were scored blinded for time and outcome of culture for the presence of pcp and fgc. fasting serum samples from all visits were used for gastrin measurements. the prevalence of pcp increased during omeprazole therapy from % at baseline to % and % at and months (p < ., baseline v both and months). the prevalence of fgc increased from % to % and % (p < ., baseline v months). the prevalence of pcp and fgc did not differ among the h pylori-positive and h pylori-negative patients at baseline (pcp % v % and fgc % v %, respectively). whereas h pylori eradication did not significantly affect development of pcp (p = .), fgc developed significantly more often in the h pylori-eradicated patients when compared with persistent h pylori-positive patients (p < .). pcp development was related to serum gastrin rise during therapy. in conclusion, pcp occurs in most patients within the first months of omeprazole treatment and is related to increased gastrin levels. fgc develops more gradually and is enhanced by h pylori eradication."

"noninvasive tests as a substitute for histology in the diagnosis of helicobacter pylori infection. rapid urease tests for helicobacter pylori have a sensitivity of % to %. therefore histologic examination of gastric biopsies is recommended as a ""backup"" diagnostic test in rapid urease test-negative patients. however, noninvasive tests (urea breath test, serology, whole blood antibody tests) may provide a more rapid diagnosis and be less expensive but offer similar accuracy."

"the benefit/risk profile of rabeprazole, a new proton-pump inhibitor. acid-related diseases such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) and peptic ulcer are a common cause of morbidity and if inadequately treated can lead to serious complications. the proton-pump inhibitor rabeprazole has been extensively evaluated in well-controlled trials in north america and europe for the acute treatment of erosive or ulcerative gord and gastric and duodenal ulcers and for the long-term maintenance of gord healing. the results show that rabeprazole has a favourable benefit/risk profile for each indication. rabeprazole and mg given once daily in the morning was highly effective in producing and maintaining healing, providing symptom relief, and improving overall well-being. healing rates for rabeprazole were equivalent to omeprazole in all indications, and superior (gord healing and duodenal ulcer healing) or equivalent (gastric ulcer healing) to the histamine -receptor antagonist ranitidine. symptom relief provided by rabeprazole was equivalent or superior to comparator drugs. rabeprazole was well tolerated in both short- and long-term studies. the incidence of treatment-emergent signs and symptoms related to rabeprazole was low, and these were generally mild or moderate in severity. the overall rate of discontinuations due to adverse events was approximately %. there were no deaths related to rabeprazole therapy. these findings indicate a favourable benefit/risk profile for each intended use."

"aims in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: a gastroenterologist's viewpoint. relieving heartburn and healing esophagitis may appear to be primary aims in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but systematic consideration of the issues demonstrates that there are discrepancies between the fundamental aims of medical management and the aims selected for study in trials of drug efficacy. the initial aims of management are those concerned with diagnosis, patient assessment and the provision of explanation and advice. the therapeutic objectives are alleviating symptoms, preventing complications and, if possible, avoiding recurrence, and should ideally be judged in terms of health gain, including quality of life improvement. obtaining value for money, by maximizing the health gain in relation to the cost of the overall medical intervention must also be acknowledged as a desirable aim of management, with the proviso that physicians must always treat each patient as an individual and individualize clinical management appropriately."

"management of helicobacter pylori infection--a working party report of the malaysian society of gastroenterology and hepatology. the working party report on the management of helicobacter pylori serves as a clinical practice guideline for malaysian doctors. h. pylori is not uncommon in the malaysian population. marked racial differences and the consistently low prevalence rates amongst malays are noted. the working party recommends that if endoscopy is to be performed, a rapid urease test should be used for diagnosis. where suspicion of the infection is strong and the urease test is negative, histology should be performed on gastric biopsies. culture should be used to monitor resistance patterns to antibiotics and regional laboratories should assume this responsibility. the urea breath tests are highly accurate tests for diagnosis of h. pylori but is as yet not widely available in malaysia. the working party strongly recommends that all peptic ulcer patients infected with h. pylori whether active, in remission and complicated ulcers should be treated for the infection. patients with low-grade gastric mucosal lymphoid tissue lymphoma should also be treated for h. pylori infection. it is considered advisable that patients on long term nonsteroidal antinflammatory drug (nsaid) treatment with a history of peptic ulcers or dyspepsia and patients following resection of early gastric cancer or those with a family history of gastric cancer should also be tested and treated for h. pylori. the working party recommends, as first line treatment a -day combination therapy of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and metronidazole or amoxicillin. high metronidazole resistance rates locally may adversely affect regimens containing the antibiotic. it should also be noted that regimens that yield lower eradication rates may result in higher long term expenditure."

"strategy for treatment of helicobacter pylori infection in adults. i. updated indications for test and eradication therapy suggested in . since the report of culture of helicobacter pylori in , there has been increasing agreement that h. pylori infection is etiologically associated with a number of important diseases including chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt) lymphoma, gastric polyps, gastric cancer, as well as suggestions that it may be involved in diseases outside the upper gastrointestinal tract. there have been a number of national and international consensus meetings to propose guidelines to treat h. pylori infection. the recommendations of these conferences are reviewed here and updated to include new indications and concepts regarding h. pylori eradication therapy. eradication therapy is considered the standard of care for active or inactive peptic ulcer patients including those who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). other strong indications include malt lymphoma, hyperplastic polyps, hyperplastic gastropathy, post-endoscopic resection for gastric malignancy, and acute h. pylori gastritis. other considerations include plan to use chronic nsaid therapy, plan for chronic anti-secretory therapy, and some extra-gastroduodenal diseases such as chronic ureterica. non-investigated dyspepsia is an indication for diagnostic evaluation and eradication therapy for those with h. pylori infection, whereas non-ulcer dyspepsia (nud) in which peptic ulcer disease has been excluded is not an indication for evaluation per se. intervention studies are now in progress to test the hypothesis that prevention of gastric malignancy is an outcome of h. pylori eradication. because the prevalence of h. pylori infection and the associated diseases such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer differ among countries as well as different approvals for treatment are required by governments or insurance agencies, the acceptable indications of eradication therapy will, by necessity, vary among countries."
"antibiotic-resistant h. pylori infection and its treatment. helicobacter pylori infection causes progressive damage to gastric mucosa and results in serious disease such as peptic ulcer disease, malt lymphoma, or gastric adenocarcinoma in % to % of patients. the current approach is to make a firm diagnosis, give combination antibiotic and antisecretory therapy, and confirm that the infection has been cured to weeks later. antimicrobial resistance is largely responsible for treatment failures. resistance to metronidazole can frequently be overcome by increasing the dose and duration of treatment with acid suppression. clarithromycin is the most effective antibiotic against h. pylori but, unfortunately, resistance to it is increasing and can not be overcome by increasing the dose or duration of therapy with clarithromycin. the choice of therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns. re-treatment regimens for treatment failure should exclude antibiotics where acquired resistance is expected (i.e., clarithromycin and possibly metronidazole). where available, treatment failure should prompt endoscopy and culture and susceptibility testing. overall, higher doses and longer durations of treatment result in the best cure rates. when multiple treatment regimens fail, salvage therapy regimens such as bismuth or furazolidone quadruple therapy (a bismuth and tetracycline hcl times a day along with a proton pump inhibitor twice a day, and either metronidazole or mg three times daily or furazolidone mg three times daily for days) can be used. newer agents are needed to cope with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among h. pylori."

"esomeprazole. esomeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor, is the s-isomer of omeprazole and is the first such inhibitor to be developed as a single isomer. esomeprazole provided better control of intragastric ph than omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole in trials conducted in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) or healthy volunteers (n = to ). in large randomised, double-blind multicentre trials esomeprazole and/or mg for weeks produced higher healing rates of erosive oesophagitis and better symptom control than omeprazole mg in patients with gord. esomeprazole , or mg once daily for months maintained healing versus placebo (p < .) in patients with endoscopically confirmed healed erosive oesophagitis in large randomised, double-blind multicentre trials. similarly, symptom-driven on-demand use of esomeprazole effectively controlled symptoms of gord (heartburn) for months in large placebo-controlled trials. esomeprazole-based triple therapy for days was as effective for eradication of helicobacter pylori as longer omeprazole-based therapy in randomised double-blind trials including about patients each. endoscopically confirmed ulcer healing weeks after treatment initiation was reported in about % of patients with active duodenal ulcer in both treatment groups. esomeprazole-based triple therapy for days was more effective than esomeprazole plus clarithromycin for eradication of h. pylori in patients."

"new treatment for barrett's oesophagus. barrett's esophagus is characterised by the presence of specialised intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus. its importance is related primarily to its link with adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, often preceded by dysplastic changes. the incidence of this carcinoma has increased dramatically over the last few decades. although modern treatments, particularly acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors, have been most useful in controlling the reflux symptoms associated with barrett's esophagus, they have not reduced the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. the same can be said about anti-reflux surgery. surgical excision of barrett's esophagus has been advocated when high-grade dysplasia is detected; this carries considerable morbidity and mortality, so alternative treatments are being developed. this update summarises recent information concerning newer treatments aimed at eradicating barrett's esophagus. these vary from thermal coagulation (using electrocoagulation and heater probes) to lasers, photodynamic therapy and mechanical methods. of these, photodynamic therapy using a porphyrin precursor (-amino-laevulinic acid) seems to give the most consistent satisfactory results with a minimum of complications. however, persistence of some metaplastic cells beneath the neo-squamous layer remains a problem. ongoing effective acid control (by medical or surgical therapy) is also essential to prevent recurrence of barrett's esophagus. future research is aimed at perfecting these methods. ultimately, it may be possible to understand the molecular biology which could help to predict which patients are at greatest risk of developing dysplastic and carcinomatous changes."

"pathogenesis and current management of gastrooesophageal-reflux-related asthma. in the past decade the use of proton pump inhibitors on the one hand, and an aggressive surgical approach on the other hand have revolutionised the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord). many studies have suggested that the successful management of gord results in improvement of the symptoms of asthma which coexist in many of these patients. in this paper we review the pathogenesis and the medical and surgical treatment of gor-related asthma. both anti-reflux operations and anti-acid medications improve gord and gor-related asthma. although anti-reflux surgery is superior to h blockers, there are not sufficient data to evaluate proton pump inhibitors compared with operation in controlling the symptoms of asthma."
"diagnosis of reflux disease. there are numerous tests for which a diagnostic value in the context of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has been claimed. some of these tests (e.g. the acid perfusion test) have become obsolete after the advent of -hour oesophageal ph monitoring. with the latter test not only can excessive reflux be identified, but also, and more importantly, a temporal relationship can be demonstrated between a patient's symptoms and reflux episodes. radiographical examination of the oesophagus has largely been replaced by endoscopy, although the use of the former test is still indicated in certain circumstances (e.g. in the differentiation of sliding from para-oesophageal hiatus hernia). in clinical practice, the so-called proton pump inhibitor test has gained considerable popularity. despite several studies on the specificity and sensitivity of this test, its value has not yet been established with sufficient accuracy. conventional manometric evaluation of lower oesophageal sphincter pressure has been over-emphasized as a diagnostic test in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease."

"helicobacter pylori infection and eradication in paediatric patients. helicobacter pylori is now recognised to be typically acquired during childhood. studies also indicate that the infection is frequently lost in childhood; however, it is still unclear whether this is related to the use of antibacterials, the natural history of the infection, or both. h. pylori colonises gastric mucosa and is causally related to chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in both children and adults. successful eradication of h. pylori has resulted in the healing of duodenal ulcers and the lowering of the ulcer relapse rate in children. therapy to cure the infection should be started in all children with peptic (duodenal or gastric) ulcer who are still infected. the ideal anti-h. pylori regimen should be safe, cheap, easy to comply with, well tolerated by children and able to achieve a high cure rate. although us data are lacking, it is anticipated that the treatment regimen for children should be similar to that in adults (a triple therapy regimen that combines a proton pump inhibitor with antimicrobial agents for days). it is inappropriate to prescribe anti-h. pylori therapy without a firm diagnosis. the use of multiple antibacterials in a paediatric patient with an ulcer but without h. pylori infection cannot provide any benefit to the patient or the community. such an approach only provides the possibility for adverse effects, for example development of antibacterial resistance among bystander bacteria. it is very important to confirm the diagnosis of h. pylori infection. the [c]urea breath test is the noninvasive method of choice to determine h. pylori status in children and the ideal test for post-therapy testing. there is a need for post-therapy confirmation because of the likelihood of poor outcome for some treatment regimens, which is why post-therapy testing should be the standard of care. there is weak and inconsistent evidence of an association between h. pylori infection and recurrent abdominal pain (rap) in children, in part because of the unclear definition of rap in the literature. therefore, there is still considerable debate regarding the treatment of infected children with rap."
"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. nsaid-associated dyspeptic symptoms are common and can be managed empirically with an h-receptor antagonist or a proton-pump inhibitor. treatment of established gastroduodenal ulcers is accomplished best by withholding the offending drugs. proton-pump inhibitors appear to heal ulcers at the same rate whether or not nsaid therapy is continued. after the ulcer is healed and if nsaid therapy must be continued, prophylaxis is accomplished best by the concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors, misoprostol (at least micrograms times a day), or a nsaid that preferentially inhibits cox-. the future development of newer, safer nsaid preparations, including highly selective cox- inhibitors and nitric oxide-releasing nsaids, should provide better treatment options for the increasing number of individuals requiring anti-inflammatory agents."

"apoptosis and osteoporosis. during normal bone remodeling, the rate of supply of new osteoblasts and osteoclasts and the timing of the death of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes by apoptosis are critical determinants of the initiation of new bmus and the extension or reduction of the lifetime of existing ones. disruption of the fine balance among these processes may be an important mechanism behind the deranged bone turnover found in most metabolic disorders of the adult skeleton. like most armies, the amount of work done by bone cells is far more dependent on numbers than vigor. therapeutic agents that alter the prevalence of apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteoclasts can correct the imbalance in cell numbers that is the basis of the diminished bone mass and increased risk of fractures in osteoporosis."

"gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd): current agents and future perspective. the objectives of medical treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) are relief of symptoms and healing of esophagitis, which can be achieved, at least in part, by drugs which suppress acid secretion. in patients with gerd symptoms and/or mild esophagitis, the best and most cost-effective therapeutic strategy is to start with a proton pump inhibitor with subsequent trial of step down of the intensity of therapy (e.g. h-receptor antagonists). in patients with moderate or severe esophagitis, proton pump inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment and the most effective in preventing symptoms and esophagitis. in patients with mild disease, the recurrence of symptoms is less frequent and many patients may not need continuous maintenance therapy or may require treatment with either low dose proton pump inhibitors, h-receptor antagonists or cisapride only. h. pylori eradication might be needed in gerd patients on long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors, but the benefit of this strategy has not yet been adequately demonstrated. antireflux surgery is a maintenance option for the young patient on long-term medical therapy. improved medical therapy for gerd might depend on future agents with different therapeutic targets, including gaba inhibitors and nitric oxide modulating drugs in the control of the lower sphincter esophagus and in motility disorders, free radical scavengers in the prevention of mucosal damage and cox- specific inhibitors in the prevention of the progression of barret's esophagus to adenocarcinoma. finally, the modulation of some growth factors might have a potential role in delayed esophageal ulcer healing, refractory esophagitis and in barrett's esophagus."

"the role of economic evaluation in the diagnosis and treatment of helicobacter pylori infection. the unfolding of the h. pylori story coupled with the high prevalence and economic burden associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes h. pylori-associated disorders an ideal candidate for economic evaluation. as a result of the high quality and quantity of data emerging, h. pylori eradication is cost-effective in individuals with either newly diagnosed or past pud. the role of eradication in other areas, for example, patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and screening to prevent gastric cancer, may never be worked out to some clinicians' satisfaction. conflicting reports and the lack of definitive clinical trials have frustrated clinicians. h. pylori diagnosis and treatment have not been integrated into everyday clinical practice. as a result, the enormous potential benefits associated with h. pylori eradication have not been achieved. economic evaluation is not a panacea to the problems confronting medical services delivery. assessments of medical practice are methodologically challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. once the answers are in, it remains difficult to alter an individual provider's patterns of care and integrate the research findings into everyday practice. further research into physician decision making is necessary to complement the advances being made in determining the value of medical interventions. the fruits of these efforts will be the more efficient delivery of health care services, which, it is hoped, ultimately will improve the health of patients. there is no reason to believe, however, that more attention to effectiveness research would lead to a reduction in health care expenditures. increasing demands for accountability of medical interventions will propel effectiveness movements. economic analyses, performed in concert with carefully designed clinical studies, will spur more critical review of health care resource allocation decisions. despite the limitations, the findings generated from effectiveness research will have a major impact on physician practices, guideline development, and reimbursement decisions. the tendency of clinicians not to pay attention to economic evaluations may lead to missed clinical benefits and unnecessary expenditures. physicians who have been reluctant to appreciate the information provided by economic evaluation must understand what other stakeholders in health care delivery already have accepted: that the rational basis for cost-effectiveness analysis is the overall improvement in the quality of health care services--not simply a tool to reduce health care costs."

"ulcer and gastritis. recent progress in the area of ulcer and gastritis is still dominated by findings and reports on helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which in turn are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. although the prevalence of h. pylori is declining in most developed countries, it is still contributing to a significant proportion of peptic ulcers globally. the interrelationship of h. pylori gastritis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux has become more apparent. h. pylori-induced gastric body gastritis is associated with reduced acid production, and thus with reduced reflux and esophagitis. the controversies regarding the interactions between h. pylori and nsaids have still not been settled. with the availability of the new cox--specific inhibitors, the current scenario of nsaid-related gastroduodenal complications will certainly change. short-term usage of these agents has significantly reduced the incidence of endoscopic ulcers, but the benefits in terms of clinical outcomes, such as bleeding or perforation, remain to be determined. this review summarizes the recent literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis."
"review article: barrett's oesophagus, dysplasia and pharmacologic acid suppression. barrett's oesophagus, a significant complication of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gerd), is the single most important risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. the strong association between barrett's oesophagus and chronic gerd suggests that abnormal oesophageal acid exposure plays an important role in this condition. the progression of barrett's oesophagus from specialized intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia and finally invasive carcinoma is incompletely understood, but increased and disordered proliferation is a key cellular event. in ex vivo organ culture experiments, cell proliferation is increased after exposure to short pulses of acid, whilst proliferation is reduced in barrett's oesophagus specimens taken from patients with oesophageal acid exposure normalized by antisecretory therapy. in long-term clinical studies, consistent and profound intra-oesophageal acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors decreases cell proliferation and increases differentiation in barrett's oesophagus, but the clinical importance of such favourable effects on these surrogate markers is not clear. in clinical practice, proton pump inhibitors relieve symptoms and induce partial regression to squamous epithelium, but abnormal oesophageal acid exposure and the risk for dysplasia or adenocarcinoma persist in many patients. the ability of proton pump inhibitors to suppress acid profoundly and consistently may be critical in the long-term management of barrett's oesophagus."

"gerd and h. pylori: is there a link? the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and esophageal adenocarcinoma have increased in recent years as the incidence of peptic ulcer disease and distal gastric cancer have declined. given the simultaneous decline in helicobacter pylori infection, it is tempting to propose a relationship between h. pylori infection and these opposing time trends. although h. pylori infection clearly does not cause gerd, it may protect certain susceptible individuals from developing gerd and its complications. the most likely mechanism in which h. pylori infection protects against gerd is by decreasing the potency of the gastric refluxate in patients with corpus predominant gastritis. a variety of implications of h. pylori infection on gerd treatment have also arisen in recent years. these focus on the risk of gastric atrophy while on proton pump inhibitor therapy and the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors before and after eradication of h. pylori. this article puts into perspective our current understanding of the complex, incompletely understood relationship between h. pylori infection and gerd."

"proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is the most common peptic acid disease in the western world and is the commonest indication for acid suppression therapy. major advances have been made over the past years in the understanding of lower oesophageal sphincter function and the mechanism of acid secretion. developments in surgical and pharmacological therapy have paralleled these advances. pharmacotherapy for gerd has evolved from antacids to h-receptor antagonists (hras) to prokinetics to proton pump inhibitors (ppis). the hras, while modestly effective in symptom relief and healing of gerd, are limited by pharmacological tolerance. the prokinetics (metoclopramide and cisapride) are limited by low efficacy, pharmacological tolerance and toxicity. the ppis have emerged as the most effective therapy for symptom relief, healing and long-term maintenance. they have also proved to be remarkably safe and cost-effective in long-term therapy. this review evaluates the pharmacology, efficacy, tolerability, safety and cost-effectiveness of the four currently available ppis, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole, in the treatment of gerd."
"clarithromycin for helicobacter pylori infection. helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative organism that survives in the deep mucus layer and attaches to the gastric surface cells, is estimated to be present in up to one-half of the us population. chronic h. pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer diseases and even gastric cancer. cure of the infection leads to healing of gastric inflammation, prevention of development of peptic ulcer, as well as accelerated healing of peptic ulcers, and prevention of ulcer recurrence. treatment of h. pylori has undergone substantial evolution over the past decade. despite the in vitro susceptibility, results from single or even dual drug therapy is typically unsatisfactory and the best therapy is yet to be defined. the best current therapies for h. pylori infection consist of a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) or ranitidine bismuth citrate and two antibiotics (triple therapies), or bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole and a ppi (quadruple therapy). clarithromycin is one of the most useful antimicrobials against h. pylori. it is an acid-stable macrolide with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, well absorbed with a wide tissue distribution and with mild side effects. clarithromycin has a low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for h. pylori and its effect is potentiated by acid inhibition. when combined with a ppi or ranitidine bismuth citrate and amoxicillin or metronidazole, eradication rates of more than % can be achieved with susceptible organisms. however, the prevalence of primary and acquired clarithromycin resistance, which is due to mutations within a conserved loop of s rrna of h. pylori, is increasing. in practice, the presence of clarithromycin resistance usually implies reduced success when clarithromycin-containing regimes are used. there is a need for improved therapies for h. pylori where antibiotic resistance is less of a problem."

"pharmacodynamic modeling of lansoprazole using an indirect irreversible response model. a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was used to assess lansoprazole effects on gastric ph. the irreversible inactivation of the h+/k+-atpase enzyme by lansoprazole controls the secretion rate of h+ ions and gastric ph values. the basal circadian rhythm of gastric acid production was taken into account as well as the effects of food intake. a model was applied to multiple-dose data from a crossover study of four dosage regimens of lansoprazole in two groups of normal male subjects. model parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression and were compared to historical values reported in the literature. the predicted mean gastric ion concentration was . mm (ph .) with the peak time at . hours (: p.m.), and the half-time for h+ removal from the stomach averaged . hours. the estimated half-life of gastric food removal was . hours. the rate constant for normal h+/k+-atpase degradation was . h(-). the pharmacodynamic parameter describing lansoprazole action on gastric acid secretion was the second-order enzyme inactivation constant, which averaged . microg(-) x l x h(-). the parameters obtained for both the baseline and drug treatment data were consistent with the literature and physiologically relevant with the exception of effective food volume, which was large presumably due to buffer effects. the model successfully incorporated the physiological regulation of gastric acid production, the effects of food on gastric acid, and the effects of multiple-dosing regimens of lansoprazole on gastric acid production to give reasonable profiles of gastric ph."
"gastroesophageal reflux disease and barrett's esophagus. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a common clinical problem. circumstantial evidence continues to suggest that infection with helicobacter pylori may protect some patients from developing gerd and its complications. an empirical trial of a proton-pump inhibitor may now be a reasonable alternative to endoscopy or -hour ph testing for the diagnosis of gerd. long-term follow-up data covering more than over a decade indicate that proton-pump inhibitors are effective and safe agents for the treatment of gerd. furthermore, a strategy of proton-pump inhibitors first may be the most cost-effective approach to gerd. it remains unclear why some patients with gerd develop barrett's esophagus, whereas others do not. recent studies demonstrate the importance of pulses of acid or bile in increasing cell proliferation and cyclooxygenase- expression in barrett's epithelium cell cultures. short-segment barrett's esophagus is now clearly associated with an increased risk of dysplasia or cancer compared to intestinal metaplasia of the cardia, and the cancer risk in this condition is similar to that with long-segment barrett's esophagus. however, the overall cancer risk in patients with barrett's esophagus is lower than previously estimated, at approximately .% annually. ablation techniques continue to show promise, but are not yet ready for routine clinical use. endoscopic mucosal resection is a new treatment option for selected patients with high-grade dysplasia or superficial esophageal adenocarcinoma."

"update in the pharmacological management of peptic ulcer haemorrhage. the management of peptic ulcer haemorrhage still poses questions and controversies and this applies to the pharmacological mode. this review suggests that high-dose acid suppression is beneficial in reducing rebleeding and surgery rates. the choice of acid suppressant is far from conclusive, but emerging evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors may be more effective than h-antagonists. the only other drug which may be useful in selected patients is octreotide, but its universal use cannot be recommended."
"cox- inhibitors vs. nsaids in gastrointestinal damage and prevention. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit production of protective gastric mucosal prostaglandins and also have a direct topical irritant effect. in some patients this results in dyspepsia and development of gastroduodenal erosions and ulceration. the risk of ulcer complications, such as bleeding, perforation and death is increased approximately -fold in nsaid users. patients at high risk of ulcer complications include the elderly, those taking anticoagulants, steroids and aspirin, those with a previous history of peptic ulceration and patients with concomitant serious medical problems. the interaction of nsaids with helicobacter pylori (the major cause of peptic ulceration in non-nsaid users) is controversial and some studies suggest that h. pylori infection may even protect against nsaid-induced ulceration. selective inhibitors of the inducible cyclooxygenase- (cox-) enzyme spare cox- in the gastric mucosa and, hence, do not inhibit production of mucosal prostaglandins. cox--selective inhibitors are associated with a significant reduction in gastroduodenal damage compared with traditional nsaids. proton pump inhibitors (ppi) are probably the best agents for healing and prevention of nsaid-induced ulcers. preliminary studies suggest that cox- selective inhibitors, like traditional nsaids, may prevent lower gastrointestinal cancer. further studies are needed but they may be useful in individuals at high risk of certain types of lower gastrointestinal malignancy with increased gastrointestinal tolerability and safety."

"reduction of acid exposure and regression of barrett's esophagus. the goals of treatment of barrett's esophagus (be) include relieving reflux symptoms, healing inflammatory lesions, and preventing esophageal adenocarcinoma. reduction of acid reflux is believed to prevent progression of be. a critical question is whether or not regression of be occurs in response to therapy with proton pump inhibitors. the natural history of be is altered both by the use of medications (over-the-counter or prescribed) and by endoscopic surveillance with periodic biopsies. regression occurs when the length and surface area of be decreases, along with the emergence of islands of squamous epithelium in the be segment. however, the extent of regression is difficult to assess because intestinal metaplasia may underlie the islands of squamous epithelial regrowth. sampling by endoscopic biopsy is useful in ruling out progression of be to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma; however, complete regression of the lesion cannot be definitively proven by this technique. to date, published clinical trials of proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with be provide evidence of increases in squamous islands in the be segment, but do not provide convincing data in support of complete regression of be. in a review of prospective studies of the treatment of be with proton pump inhibitors (ppis) (with or without surgery), only of patients had apparent complete reversal of be. this article reviews the current understanding of regression in be following treatment with ppis."
"what is the optimal medical therapy for barrett's esophagus? the development of barrett's esophagus (be) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is troubling because of its known association with esophageal cancer. when evaluated clinically, patients with be have the severest form of gerd and require aggressive therapy to control esophageal acid exposure. both hypotension of the lower esophageal sphincter and the extent of esophageal acid exposure are major contributors to severe gerd and its complications. it is hypothesized that better control of acid will improve outcomes for be patients. while it is clear that therapy (medical or surgical) for reflux rarely if ever results in total regression of be, there are some limited data to support improvement in be with control of reflux. current medical choices include prokinetic agents, histamine type- receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors. in the future, genetic markers may be used in identifying be patients at the greatest risk for histologic progression, and chemoprevention with cyclooxygenase- inhibitors may be a therapeutic option. this paper will review the rationale for and results of medical antireflux therapy in patients with be."

"[the effect of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on efficacy of helicobacter pylori eradication]. none of the drug regimens used to treat h. pylori infection ensures % of efficacy. one may think therefore that among factors modifying h. pylori eradication there are also cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. the aim of the study was to determine the influence of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on efficacy of h. pylori eradication. the study was conducted on h. pylori positive peptic ulcer patients treated with either oat-omeprazole ( x mg), amoxycillin ( x mg), tinidazole ( x mg) ( patients) or oac-omeprazole ( x mg), amoxycillin ( x mg), clarithromycin ( x mg) ( patients). detailed information on smoking and drinking habits was obtained from a questionnaire fulfilled by all subjects. patients were defined as smokers if smoked or more cigarettes per day and as drinkers if drank g or more alcohol per week. to enter the study patients had to have confirmed h. pylori infection by two tests (clo-test and histology). eradication was considered successful if both tests gave negative results - weeks after the cessation of treatment. the efficacy of h. pylori eradication was similar in both groups (oat--.%, oac--.%). patients who smoked cigarettes had lower rate of h. pylori eradication in oac group (smokers .%, non-smokers .%, p < .), while patients who drank alcohol had higher eradication rate in oat group (drinkers .%, non-drinkers .%, p < .). when two factors (smoking, drinking) were analyzed together, it was found that in drinkers treated with oat, smoking did not change the efficacy of h. pylori eradication, while in non-drinkers decreased by two times (.% vs .%, p < .). in drinkers treated with oac, smoking did not change the efficacy of h. pylori eradication (but this was likely related to the limited number of patients), while decreased it in non-drinkers from .% to .% (p < .). when two groups were analyzed together (oat + oac), the lowest efficacy of h. pylori eradication exhibited smokers who do not drink (.%) followed by smokers who drink (.%), non-smokers who do not drink (.%) and non-smokers who drink (.%); in each case the efficacy of eradication was higher than in smokers who do not drink (p < ., p < ., p < ., respectively). both cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption can affect the efficacy of h. pylori eradication. smoking and drinking habits should be taken into account, when the set of drugs for h. pylori eradication is chosen."

"pantoprazole. the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of pantoprazole are reviewed. pantoprazole is a gastric hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (h+/k(+)-atpase) inhibitor. it shares the same core structure as other currently available proton-pump inhibitors (ppis). the fda-labeled indication is the short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis. ppis act by selectively inhibiting h+/k(+)-atpase in the secretory canaliculus of the stimulated parietal cell. understanding the pharmacodynamics of ppis is more relevant than knowing their pharmacokinetics, since the duration of action depends on the rate of de novo proton-pump regeneration, not the duration of drug circulation in the body. pantoprazole is well absorbed, undergoes little first-pass metabolism, and has an absolute bioavailability of approximately %. pantoprazole has been evaluated in more than clinical trials involving more than , patients. it is effective in treating erosive esophagitis and duodenal and gastric ulcers. it is also effective as adjunctive treatment with antimicrobials in patients infected with helicobacter pylori. pantoprazole has been shown to control acid production in zollinger-ellison syndrome. pantoprazole is well tolerated. the most commonly reported adverse effects are headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. the recommended oral dosage for erosive esophagitis is mg once a day for up to eight weeks. the recommended i.v. dose is mg given over minutes once a day in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are unable to take oral medication. pantoprazole appears to be as safe and effective as other ppis in acid-related disorders."

"pharmacokinetic studies with esomeprazole, the (s)-isomer of omeprazole. this article reviews the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole, the (s)-isomer of the proton pump inhibitor (ppi) omeprazole. esomeprazole is the first single isomer ppi developed for the treatment of patients with acid-related diseases. in vitro experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrated that the formation of the hydroxy and -o-desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole is via cytochrome p (cyp) c, whereas that of the sulphone metabolite is via cypa. the formation rate of the hydroxy metabolite from esomeprazole is lower than for (r)-omeprazole, but that of the other metabolites is higher, demonstrating stereoselective metabolism. the sum of the intrinsic clearances of all metabo- lites for esomeprazole was one-third of that for (r)-omeprazole, suggesting lower clearance of esomeprazole in vivo. in vivo investigations demonstrated that esomeprazole is chirally stable after administration. esomeprazole is % bound to plasma proteins. in normal (extensive) metabolisers with regard to cypc, esomeprazole is metabolised more slowly than omeprazole, resulting in a higher area under the concentration-time curve (auc) after administration of the same dose. this is more pronounced after repeated administration rather than after a single dose. in poor metabolisers, the auc is lower for esomeprazole than for omeprazole, contributing to less overall interindividual variability for esomeprazole than for omeprazole. in general, esomeprazole and omeprazole are subject to the same metabolic transformations. almost complete recoveries were reported and the ratio between urinary and faecal excretion is about : for both compounds. the dose-dependent increase in auc of esomeprazole with repeated administration results from a combination of decreased first-pass elimination and decreased systemic clearance. patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease exhibit a pharmacokinetic pattern similar to that in healthy individuals, whereas elderly individuals exhibited a slightly lower metabolism rate. patients with a severe deficit in their liver function had a lower rate of metabolism, as would be expected, whereas those with mild to moderate liver disease did not exhibit any alteration in the pharmacokinetics. the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole in individuals with impaired renal function is unlikely to differ from that in healthy individuals. a slight sex difference in the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole was demonstrated in that the auc and peak plasma drug concentration were slightly, but not statistically significantly, higher in females than in males."

"review article: is helicobacter pylori relevant in the management of reflux disease? data on the interaction of reflux disease and helicobacter pylori infection are limited in scope and rigour, controversial and difficult to interpret. despite this, a framework of understanding is emerging, which is consistent with known effects on gastric acid secretion. in patients with moderate to severe h. pylori-induced corpus gastritis, eradication can increase substantially impaired gastric acid secretion sufficiently to precipitate reflux disease in people with pre-existing sub-clinical defective gastro-oesophageal competence. by contrast, reflux disease in duodenal ulcer patients probably benefits from eradication of h. pylori. there appears to be no significant impact on reflux disease from eradication in healthy subjects or individuals whose primary problem is reflux disease. helicobacter pylori-infected reflux disease patients respond slightly better to proton pump inhibitors. these agents cause a topographic alteration of gastritis from antrum to corpus, the clinical significance of which is controversial. many practitioners misjudge the risks and benefits of the effects of h. pylori eradication on reflux disease. regardless of patient diagnosis, the balance is in favour of h. pylori eradication. for those in whom reflux oesophagitis development is a defined possibility, oesophagitis is mild, easily treated and most unlikely to be associated with any major risk for development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma."

"drug interaction studies with esomeprazole, the (s)-isomer of omeprazole. esomeprazole, the (s)-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor (ppi) developed as a single isomer for the treatment of patients with acid related diseases. because of the extensive use of ppis, the documentation of the potential for drug interactions with esomeprazole is of great importance. altered absorption or metabolism are of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions. since intragastric ph will increase with esomeprazole treatment, it can be hypothesised that the absorption of drugs with ph-sensitive absorption (e.g. digoxin and ketoconazole) may be affected. esomeprazole does not seem to have any potential to interact with drugs that are metabolised by cytochrome p (cyp) a, a, c, d or e. in drug interaction studies with diazepam, phenytoin and (r)-warfarin, it was shown that esomeprazole has the potential to interact with cypc. the slightly altered metabolism of cisapride was also suggested to be the result of inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for cisapride mediated by cypc. esomeprazole did not interact with the cypa substrates clarithromycin ( studies) or quinidine. since the slightly increased area under the concentration-time curve (auc) of cisapride could be explained as an inhibition of cypc, the data on these cypa substrates indicate that esomeprazole does not have the potential to inhibit this enzyme. the minor effects reported for diazepam, phenytoin, (r)-warfarin, and cisapride are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. clarithromycin interacts with the metabolism of esomeprazole resulting in a doubling of the auc of esomeprazole. the increased plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are unlikely to have any safety implications. it can be concluded that the potential for drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole is low, and similar to that reported for omeprazole."

"helicobacter pylori: a debated factor in gastroesophageal reflux disease. the prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection is steadily decreasing in developing countries, and this has been paralleled by an increasing incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and of the esophagogastric junction. the prevalence of h. pylori infection, which is on the decline in europe and in the united states, is probably related to improvements in sanitary conditions and socioeconomic status. these epidemiological data do not support a role for h. pylori in the pathogenesis of gerd, but at the same time suggest a negative association with the rising incidence in esophageal diseases. while h. pylori infection clearly does not cause gerd, it may protect certain susceptible individuals from the development of gerd and its complications. there are conflicting reports that gerd can develop after h. pylori eradication and that proton pump inhibitors are less effective in suppressing intragastric acidity in h. pylori negative patients--reasons not to eradicate h. pylori in gerd patients. on the contrary, other data suggest an increase in the development of atrophic gastritis in gerd patients (h. pylori positive) on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy - a reason to eradicate h. pylori. preexisting lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, susceptibility to gerd, unmasking of latent gerd, and patterns and severity of gastritis may be important factors contributing to the development of gerd rather than just the presence or absence of infection with h. pylori."

"pharmacoeconomic issues of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is one of the most common diagnoses in a gastroenterologist's practice. gastroesophageal reflux (ger) describes the retrograde movement of gastric contents through the lower oesophageal sphincter (les) to the oesophagus. ger can occur physiologically and may be accompanied by symptoms. the introduction of endoscopes and ambulatory devices for continuous monitoring of oesophageal ph ( h ph monitoring) has led to great improvement in the ability to diagnose reflux disease and reflux-associated complications. the development of pathological reflux and gerd can be attributed to many factors. pathophysiology of gerd includes transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (tlesrs), incompetent les because of a decreased lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (lesp) and deficient or delayed oesophageal acid clearance. uncomplicated gerd may be treated by modification of lifestyle and eating habits in an early stage of gerd. the various agents currently used for treatment of gerd include mucoprotective substances, antacids, h-blockers, prokinetics and proton pump inhibitors (ppis). although these drugs are effective, they do not necessarily influence the underlying causes of the disease by improving the oesophageal clearance, increasing the lesp or reducing the frequency of tlesrs. the following article gives an overview regarding current concepts of the pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of gerd stressing on pharmacoeconomic issues of the treatment and discusses the advantages and disadvantages for step-up and step-down therapy."

"medical, surgical, and endoscopic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and barrett's esophagus. over the past decade, medical and surgical approaches to the patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) have improved dramatically. proton pump inhibitors have become the dominant medical therapy because of their high efficacy and safety. laparoscopic surgical approaches have improved concomitantly with the advances in medical therapy, resulting in the perception that either continuous medical therapy or surgery are appropriate options for long-term maintenance of this chronic disorder. recent approval of new endoscopic treatments for gerd has generated considerable interest, but acceptance of these techniques should be limited by the small number of patients studied to date, the lack of placebo controls, and the short duration of follow-up."

"helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. the complex interaction between h. pylori and nsaids implies that it is over simplistic to conclude that their relationship is independent, synergistic, or antagonistic without considering the influence of other factors. factors such as previous exposure to nsaids, a history of ulcer complication, concurrent use of acid-suppressant therapy, and the difference between nsaids and low-dose aspirin all affect the outcome. several recommendations can be made with regard to the indications of h. pylori eradication for patients requiring nsaids. first, patients taking nsaids who have ulcers or previous ulcer disease should be tested for the bacterium, and it should be eradicated if present because it is impossible to determine whether the ulcers are caused by h. pylori or nsaids or both. antiulcer drugs should be prescribed to prevent ulcer recurrence for patients who continue to require nsaids. although the efficacy of omeprazole is enhanced by h. pylori infection, it is not justified to leave a pathogen in the stomach in exchange for a modest therapeutic gain. second, for patients who take low-dose aspirin, eradication of h. pylori substantially reduces the risk of ulcer bleeding. it is advisable that patients taking low-dose aspirin who are at risk of ulcer bleeding should be tested for h. pylori and treated for it if the infection is found. third, for patients who are about to start nsaids, screen-and-treat h. pylori has the potential of reducing the ulcer risk at an affordable incremental cost. it might be argued that any interaction between h. pylori and nsaids would become irrelevant in the era of cox--selective nsaids. even among patients who are receiving a cox--selective nsaid, however, a large-scale study showed that the ulcer risk is significantly higher in h. pylori-positive patients than in uninfected patients. this finding suggests that the relative importance of h. pylori in ulcer development might increase with a reduced toxicity of cox--selective nsaids. with an increasing use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis, the problem of aspirin-related ulcer disease is expected to rise. given the significant role of h. pylori in the latter condition, screen-and-treat h. pylori might be a useful strategy for the prevention of ulcer complications in high-risk patients receiving low-dose aspirin in the future."
"rabeprazole: an update of its use in acid-related disorders. rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump. it causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion. in -week studies, among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord), rabeprazole mg/day or mg twice daily was as effective as omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in the healing of gord. symptom relief with rabeprazole was superior to that provided by placebo and ranitidine and similar to omeprazole. in long-term trials rabeprazole mg/day was similar to omeprazole mg/day in a -year study and superior to placebo in -year studies, in both the maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed gord. in nonerosive gord, -week studies have shown rabeprazole to be more effective than placebo in relieving heartburn and various other gastrointestinal symptoms. data among patients with barrett's oesophagus suggest rabeprazole mg/day may be more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of associated oesophagitis after year of treatment. one-week triple helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with rabeprazole plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin achieved eradication rates of > or =%. rabeprazole is as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole when included as part of a triple-therapy regimen for the eradication of h. pylori. eradication rates of >% were achieved when rabeprazole to mg/day was included as part of a quadruple eradication regimen. as monotherapy for peptic ulcer healing and symptom relief, - to -week studies have shown rabeprazole to mg/day to be superior to placebo and ranitidine and have similar efficacy to omeprazole. preliminary -year data among patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome suggest rabeprazole to mg/day can resolve and prevent the recurrence of symptoms and endoscopic lesions associated with this condition. in clinical trials of up to years' duration the tolerability of rabeprazole is similar to that of placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole. common adverse events assigned to rabeprazole have been diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis, nausea, pharyngitis and abdominal pain. histological changes and increases in serum gastrin levels were unremarkable and typical of proton pump inhibitors. no dosage adjustment is necessary in renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment."

"lansoprazole: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical uses. lansoprazole (prevacid, tap pharmaceuticals, inc.) is a substituted benzimidazole that inhibits gastric acid secretion. this agent is approved for the short-term treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, active gastric ulcer, active duodenal ulcer and the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid)-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. it is also approved for the long-term treatment of healed reflux oesophagitis, healed duodenal ulcer, the treatment of hypersecretory conditions such as zollinger-ellison syndrome and the eradication of helicobacter pylori as a component of triple therapy with lansoprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or dual therapy with lansoprazole and amoxicillin. its mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit the membrane enzyme h+/k+ atpase in gastric parietal cells. in clinical trials, lansoprazole is more effective than placebo or histamine (h)-receptor antagonists in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. lansoprazole administered at a dose of mg daily produced faster relief of symptoms and superior healing rates in patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers or reflux oesophagitis than h-receptor antagonists. a daily dose of mg lansoprazole reduced epigastric pain faster than omeprazole mg daily in patients with peptic ulcer disease but healing rates at and weeks were similar with both agents at these dosages. lansoprazole was more effective than h-receptor antagonists in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome and produced similar treatment outcome to omeprazole. lansoprazole in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin produced similar rates of eradication of h. pylori. in clinical trials, lansoprazole is well-tolerated and has a low frequency of side effects similar to that of h-receptor antagonists or omeprazole."
"brazilian consensus on gastroesophageal reflux disease: proposals for assessment, classification, and management. the brazilian consensus on gastroesophageal reflux disease considers gastroesophageal reflux disease to be a chronic disorder related to the retrograde flow of gastroduodenal contents into the esophagus and/or adjacent organs, resulting in a variable spectrum of symptoms, with or without tissue damage. considering the limitations of classifications currently in use, a new classification is proposed that combines three criteria-clinical, endoscopic, and ph-metric-providing a comprehensive and more complete characterization of the disease. the diagnosis begins with the presence of heartburn, acid regurgitation, and alarm manifestations (dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, gi bleeding, nausea and/or vomiting, and family history of cancer). also, atypical esophageal, pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, and oral symptoms may occur. endoscopy is the first approach, particularly in patients over yr of age and in those with alarm symptoms. other exams are considered in particular cases, such as contrast radiological examination, scyntigraphy, manometry, and prolonged ph measurement. the clinical treatment encompasses behavioral modifications in lifestyle and pharmacological measures. proton pump inhibitors in manufacturers' recommended doses are indicated, with doubling of the dose in more severe cases of esophagitis. the minimum time of administration is wk. patients who do not respond to medical treatment, including those with atypical manifestations, should be considered for surgical treatment. of the complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease, barrett's esophagus presents a potential development of adenocarcinoma; biopsies should be performed, independent of barrett's esophagus extent or location. in this regard the designation ""short barrett's"" is not important in terms of management and prognosis."

"mucosal ablation in barrett's esophagus. barrett's esophagus is a prevalent, premalignant condition affecting the gastroesophageal junction and distal esophagus. ablation plus antireflux therapy has recently been advocated to prevent the development of adenocarcinoma or to treat those unfit or unwilling to undergo esophagectomy. the present article, based on a search of medline/isi databases and cross-referencing of relevant articles, reviews the literature on this subject. a number of techniques have been used to remove the affected mucosa, including laser, electrocoagulation, argon plasma coagulation and photodynamic therapy but, as yet, none has been shown to be superior. depending on the method used, ablation results in complete removal of barrett's esophagus in approximately one third of patients and a partial response in nearly two-thirds. the resultant squamous mucosa is apparently 'normal' but may regress. to promote and maintain regeneration, antireflux therapy must be sufficient to reduce repetitive injury to the esophageal mucosa. whether ablation reduces the cancer risk or delays its occurrence is unknown, though recent data suggests benefit. complications are infrequent and usually mild. regular follow-up endoscopy and deep biopsies continue to be necessary. careful data from much larger populations with long-term follow-up is required before ablation reaches the stage of broad clinical application."

"esomeprazole: a review of its use in the management of acid-related disorders. esomeprazole (s-isomer of omeprazole), the first single optical isomer proton pump inhibitor, generally provides better acid control than current racemic proton pump inhibitors and has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile relative to omeprazole. in a large well designed -week trial in patients (n >) with erosive oesophagitis, esomeprazole recipients achieved significantly higher rates of endoscopically confirmed healed oesophagitis than those receiving lansoprazole. respective healed oesophagitis rates with once-daily esomeprazole mg or lansoprazole mg were . and .%. overall, esomeprazole was also better than omeprazole, although these differences were not always statistically significance. ninety-two to % of esomeprazole recipients (mg once daily) achieved healed oesophagitis versus to % of omeprazole recipients (mg once daily). esomeprazole was effective across all baseline grades of oesophagitis; notably, relative to lansoprazole, as baseline severity of disease increased, the difference in rates of healed oesophagitis also increased in favour of esomeprazole. resolution of heartburn was also significantly better with esomeprazole mg than with these racemic proton pump inhibitors. long-term (up to months) therapy with esomeprazole effectively maintained healing in these patients. once-daily esomeprazole or mg for weeks resolved symptoms in patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) without oesophagitis. symptoms were effectively managed in the long-term with symptom-driven on-demand esomeprazole ( or mg once daily). eradicating helicobacter pylori infection is considered pivotal to successfully managing duodenal ulcer disease. seven days' treatment (twice-daily esomeprazole mg plus amoxicillin g and clarithromycin mg) eradicated h. pylori in >/=% of patients (intention-to-treat), a rate that was similar to equivalent omeprazole-based regimens. esomeprazole is generally well tolerated, both as monotherapy and in combination with antimicrobial agents, with a tolerability profile similar to that of other proton pump inhibitors. few patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-emergent adverse events (<% of patients), with very few (<%) drug-related serious adverse events reported."
rabeprazole in nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease: a randomized placebo-controlled trial. clinical results to date suggest that antisecretory therapy may be less effective in providing symptom relief for patients with nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) than for patients with erosive disease. this study was carried out to assess the efficacy and rapidity of once-daily rabeprazole ( mg or mg) in relieving symptoms in endoscopically negative patients with moderately severe gerd symptoms and to evaluate the safety of these doses over wk.
"indications for helicobacter pylori eradication therapy and first-line therapy regimen in japan: recommendation by the japanese society for helicobacter research. in november , eradication therapy for helicobacter pylori infection was approved under the present japanese system of health insurance. before the approval, the japanese guideline of ""diagnosis and treatment of h. pylori infection"" was made by the guideline committee of the japanese society for helicobacter research. indications for h. pylori eradication therapy were classified into three groups: (a) recommended: gastric and duodenal ulcers; (b) recommended and managed at a specialized institution: low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; (c) current studies of the significance of the therapy: following endoscopic mucosal resection of early gastric cancer and gastric surgery for gastric cancers, hyperplastic gastric polyp, atrophic gastritis, and nonulcer dyspepsia. the first-line therapy regimen recommended is week of triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor standard dose twice a day, amoxicillin mg bid, and clarithromycin or mg bid. the reasons for preferring this regimen are to avoid extensive use of metronidazole, which is allowed for treatment of trichomonas infection in japan, and the low rate of emergence of clarithromycin-resistant h. pylori with amoxicillin co-therapy. for second-line therapy patients should be referred to specialists, who can examine the susceptibility of h. pylori isolates against antibiotics and have much experience with this therapy."
"helicobacter pylori: consensus and controversy. helicobacter pylori is uniquely adapted to colonize the human stomach. infection leads to a range of subclinical and clinical outcomes that depend on properties of the infecting strain, the host, and the environment. eradication therapy is indicated for infected persons who develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric lymphoma or who are beginning long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. however, treatment may worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. h. pylori infections can be diagnosed noninvasively and can be eradicated with approximately % success by a variety of multidrug, --day regimens. unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is affecting treatment effectiveness in the united states and abroad. a more complete understanding of the variation in h. pylori pathogenesis should lead to clearer recommendations about treatment for infected persons who have neither peptic ulcer disease nor gastric lymphoma."
"distribution and partial characterisation of igg fc binding protein in various mucin producing cells and body fluids. mucus released from goblet cells is important in intestinal mucosal defence, and mucin glycoproteins are thought to be major components of mucus. recently, we identified and cloned another component of human colonic mucus, igg fc binding protein (fc gamma bp). fc gamma bp is immunologically distinct from known fc gamma receptors and its structure contains repeated cysteine rich unit sequences resembling those present in mucins. in this work, we assessed the tissue distribution of fc gamma bp, its binding activity in various body fluids, and its ability to inhibit complement mediated haemolysis."
"role of nitric oxide in gastric motor and sensory functions in healthy subjects. impaired accommodation and hypersensitivity to distension of the proximal stomach are considered to be important factors in the pathogenesis of dyspeptic complaints. as fundus relaxing agents may be effective in the treatment of these symptoms, insight into the mediators involved in fundic accommodation and associated perceptual responses is important. therefore, we studied the effect of nitric oxide (no) synthase inhibition by n(g)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma) on fundic tone, postprandial sensations, and gastric perception in healthy volunteers."

"gastroesophageal reflux disease: new treatments. the primary therapeutic endpoint for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is complete relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life. the withdrawal of cisapride has created a vacuum in the prokinetic market, with few promising drugs in the pipeline. reflux inhibitors are being considered for clinical trials, but as of yet are unavailable. proton pump inhibitors (ppis) continue to be the backbone of therapy for acid suppression, providing excellent relief of symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. isomeric technology with esomeprazole as the prototype represents an advance in ppi pharmacology. antireflux surgery is now more patient-friendly, with shorter hospitalization and less major morbidity compared to open fundoplication, but surgery is at best equal to medical therapy when optimal doses of antisecretory therapy are used. two endoscopic procedures were recently approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: radiofrequency energy delivery to the gastroesophageal junction, and transoral flexible endoscopic suturing. these techniques should be used selectively until we have more data and until results are compared to the safe and highly effective medical therapies."
the natural course of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children. the consequences of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) starting in childhood have not been widely studied. our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of endoscopy in the primary diagnosis of gerd and to investigate the long-term course of this disease in children.
on-demand treatment in patients with oesophagitis and reflux symptoms: comparison of lansoprazole and omeprazole. there are few data on how patients on maintenance treatment of reflux oesophagitis take their medication. this study was designed to investigate the dosing patterns of patients on on-demand treatment and to compare lansoprazole with omeprazole in this regard.
"esomeprazole: a clinical review. the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of esomeprazole are reviewed. esomeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor (ppi), is the s-isomer of omeprazole. esomeprazole has fda-approved labeling for use in the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), including healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and as part of a triple-drug regimen for helicobocter pylori infection. esomeprazole is structurally similar to other ppis but is the first ppi to include only the active isomer, which may lead to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. esomeprazole maintains intragastric ph at a higher level and above for a longer period than other ppis. clinical studies have shown that esomeprazole is at least equivalent in safety and efficacy to other drugs in the class. esomeprazole has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of erosive esophagitis, the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and the treatment of signs and symptoms of gerd. effective dosages are or mg orally every day or as needed. esomeprazole magnesium mg once daily in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin is effective in eradicating h. pylori infection. the potential for interacting with other drugs is limited and is similar to that of omeprazole. the most common adverse effects are headache, respiratory infection, and abdominal symptoms. esomeprazole has pharmacokinetic properties that may make it more effective than omeprazole in some patients."

"on-demand and intermittent therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: economic considerations. since gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) is a prevalent condition characterised by frequent relapses, long-term costs of management for this disease are high. thus, strategies to decrease resource expenditures without impairing patient quality of life are desirable. on-demand therapy (one-dose when symptoms occur) and intermittent therapy (short course of medication when symptoms occur) are attractive since pharmaceutical expenditures may be decreased, and many patients self-employ this strategy. the purpose of this paper was to examine the economic implications of on-demand or intermittent therapy for gord. a review of selected studies evaluating medication suitable for on-demand or intermittent administration was performed. a complete search for published studies on the cost effectiveness of on-demand or intermittent therapy for gord was conducted, and the results discussed in detail. antacids, alginates, topically active agents, histamine()-receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors have all demonstrable efficacy compared with placebo when administered on-demand. proton pump inhibitors constitute the most effective pharmacological means to treat gord. although step-up strategies initially using less potent medication may decrease resource use, cost-effectiveness analysis illustrates that on-demand or intermittent therapy with proton pump inhibitors may be reasonable options. further work that defines quality of life and patient preferences associated with gord may allow for proper allocation of resources for the management of this condition."
"efficacy and tolerability of ranitidine bismuth citrate plus amoxycillin and clarithromycin as first- or second-line therapy to cure helicobacter pylori infection. ranitidine bismuth citrate has recently been introduced for the treatment of h. pylori infection and obtains good eradication rates; however, eradication failures still appear in a considerable proportion of cases. the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ranitidine bismuth citrate plus amoxycillin and clarithromycin as first- or second-line therapy to cure h. pylori infection."

"new strategies for the prevention and treatment of helicobacter pylori infection. helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of > % of the human population worldwide, with higher prevalence in the developing countries. a strict correlation between h. pylori infection and gastroduodenal diseases has been demonstrated, including gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. current therapies against h. pylori consist of an antisecretory plus antibiotics. these therapies are effective in - % of the cases; presently, no alternative therapies have been shown to give comparable or better results. there are two main reasons for therapy failure: poor compliance, which results in cure discontinuation, and antibiotic resistance. to overcome the drawbacks inherent to any antibiotic therapy, a prophylactic vaccine seems to be the most reasonable approach. vaccines have been developed based on data obtained in animal models, a number of which are currently in phase i clinical trials, in some cases giving encouraging data for safety and immunogenicity. in the absence of any immunological correlate of protection against h. pylori, it will be possible to evaluate the efficacy of these vaccines only in large phase iii clinical trials."
"proton pump inhibitors: an update. since their introduction in the late s, proton pump inhibitors have demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine h-receptor blockers. proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. proton pump inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. the proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy."
"impact of helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on gastric ulcerogenesis in experimental animals and in humans. helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) are the most common pathogens in the gastroduodenal mucosa in animals and humans, but their relationship in ulcerogenesis has been little studied. according to some authors, h. pylori infection in humans does not act synergistically with nsaid on ulcer healing, therefore, there is no need to eradicate the germ. this notion is supported by the finding that the eradication of h. pylori does not affect nsaid-induced gastropathy treated with omeprazole and that h. pylori infection induces a strong cyclooxygenase- expression resulting in excessive biosynthesis of gastroprotective prostaglandins, which should in turn counteract nsaid-induced gastropathy and heal the existing ulcer. other investigators claim that h. pylori infection acts synergistically with nsaid on ulcer development, therefore, h. pylori should be eradicated, particularly at the start of long-term nsaid therapy. maastricht - consensus also recommends eradication prior to nsaid treatment, but this eradication does not appear to accelerate ulcer healing or to prevent the recurrent ulcers in nsaid users. our studies in almost , dyspeptic patients undergoing upper endoscopy and [()c]-urea breath test (ubt) revealed that about % of these patients are h. pylori (+) and about .% of these develop gastroduodenal ulcers. of these ulcers, over % were h. pylori (+) positive, % nsaid (+), % were both h. pylori (+) and nsaid (+), while % ulcers were h. pylori (-) and nsaid (-) or ""idiopathic"" ulcers. basically, our results support hawkey's concept and this also agrees with our findings in the rat model showing that: () there is no synergistic interaction between h. pylori infection and nsaid on gastric ulcer development, () h. pylori and nsaid are independent risk factors for peptic ulceration, and () nsaid therapy in h. pylori positive patients attenuates the ulcer development possibly due to direct inhibitory action of these drugs on h. pylori."

relative contribution of mucosal injury and helicobacter pylori in the development of gastroduodenal lesions in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. a past history of peptic ulceration increases the risk of an ulcer developing during non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) use. whether this is due to helicobacter pylori infection or to reactivation of the original lesion is unclear.

"[prostaglandin derivatives--indication and critical points]. after discovery of h. pylori, management of peptic ulcer disease (pud) is getting much easier. however, four thousands a year still died caused by this disease in japan. ten to twenty percent of the non-nsaids ulcer could be expected to remain after complete eradication of h. pylori; the number could be still ,-, a year in japan. furthermore, nsaids ulcer would not decrease in number in the post-h. pylori era. recurrence of ulcer is related to the quality of ulcer healing. deficiency of prostaglandins(pg) in the mucosa is another main reason than h. pylori infection of poor quality of ulcer healing. therefore, a pg analogue may be a most reasonable tool for treatment of h. pylori-negative pud including nsaids ulcer, but is often poorly tolerated because of diarrhea and abdominal pain. the mucosal damage caused by nsaids is also gastric acid-dependent and so, an h-receptor antagonist is to some extent effective although the efficacy is far behind of that with a pg-analogue. recently, a proton-pump inhibitor has been reported to exert the same effect as a pg-analogue in healing of gastroduodenal mucosal damage caused by nsaids and the superior effect in preventing recurrence of the damage with better tolerance. this results suggest that strong acid inhibition is highly effective for such damage. whether such strong acid inhibition causes disturbance of absorption of nsaids is not clear, which might result in poor antiinflammatory effect. elderly patients often have tendency of constipation and less possibility of pregnancy. therefore, a pg-analogue may be not only safe but also more favorable for such patients."

"helicobacter pylori: the challenge in therapy. for the therapeutic management of helicobacter pylori infection, the maastricht - consensus report have introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. according to this consensus statement, the first-line therapy for h. pylori eradication is a combination of the proton pump inhibitors (ppi) or ranitidine bismuth citrate (rbc) and claritromycin plus either amoxicillin or metronidazole. the second-line treatment is suggested to be ppi-quadruple therapy for a minimum of days. if bismuth compounds are not available, ppi-based triple therapy will have to be used as a second-line treatment only after susceptibility testing. since no considerable progress has been made during the past year in treatment regimens, there is still a need for new compounds that are specific for h. pylori, which could constitute future therapies."
"helicobacter pylori infection in geriatrics. the prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection increases with age worldwide. however, the percentage of h. pylori-positive elderly patients who are tested and treated for their infection remains very low. we now have data that demonstrate the benefit of curing h. pylori infection in elderly patients with h. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease and severe chronic gastritis. furthermore, the cure of h. pylori may prevent progression of intestinal metaplasia and gastric atrophy. studies are needed to clarify the role of eradication for elderly patients who have nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and who use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. h. pylori infection may be easily diagnosed by histological evaluation, rapid urease test or culture performed on gastric biopsies taken during endoscopy. however, the biopsy site must be carefully selected in elderly patients. for noninvasive monitoring of h. pylori infection after treatment, the c-urea breath test has significantly higher accuracy than serology in the elderly. the role of the h. pylori stool antigen test in old age still needs to be clarified. one-week ppi-based triple therapy regimens including clarithromycin, amoxycillin and/or nitroimidazoles are highly effective and well tolerated in elderly patients. low doses of both ppis and clarithromycin (in combination with standard doses of amoxycillin or nitroimidazoles) are sufficient. antibiotic resistance and low compliance are the main factors related to treatment failure at any age."
"short-term omeprazole treatment does not influence biochemical parameters of bone turnover in children. gastric proton pump inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of dyspeptic problems and for the eradication of h. pylori infection. data are not available on whether omeprazole, a representative of proton pump inhibitors, influences the function of osteoclastic h+-pump in children. we studied the impact of short-term omeprazole administration on the biochemical parameters of bone turnover in pediatric patients. urinary calcium excretion, serum total alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen type crosslinked c-telopeptide, and osteocalcin levels were determined in children [ girls ( prepubertal) and boys ( prepubertal)] before and after weeks of omeprazole treatment at a dose of mg/day. the measured parameters were within the healthy reference range in each patient. none of them altered during the study in any age or in any gender. we conclude that omeprazole, at a dose of mg/day, does not significantly influence the investigated biochemical parameters of osteoclast and osteoblast function in pediatric patients."
"dietary antioxidants and dna damage in patients on long-term acid-suppression therapy: a randomized controlled study. free radicals and reactive species produced in vivo can trigger cell damage and dna modifications resulting in carcinogenesis. dietary antioxidants trap these species limiting their damage. the present study evaluated the role of vitamins c and e in the prevention of potentially premalignant modifications to dna in the human stomach by supplementing patients who, because of hypochlorhydria and possible depletion of gastric antioxidants, could be at increased risk of gastric cancer. patients undergoing surveillance for barrett's oesophagus (n ), on long-term proton pump inhibitors were randomized into two groups: vitamin c ( mg twice/d) and vitamin e ( mg twice/d) for weeks (the supplemented group) or placebo. those attending for subsequent endoscopy had gastric juice, plasma and mucosal measurements of vitamin levels and markers of dna damage. seventy-two patients completed the study. plasma ascorbic acid, total vitamin c and vitamin e were elevated in the supplemented group consistent with compliance. gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin c levels were raised significantly in the supplemented group (p=.) but supplementation had no effect on the mucosal level of this vitamin. however, gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin c were within normal ranges in the unsupplemented group. mucosal malondialdehyde, chemiluminescence and dna damage levels in the comet assay were unaffected by vitamin supplementation. in conclusion, supplementation does not affect dna damage in this group of patients. this is probably because long-term inhibition of the gastric proton pump alone does not affect gastric juice ascorbate and therefore does not increase the theoretical risk of gastric cancer because of antioxidant depletion."

"gastroesophageal reflux in children: pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and role of proton pump inhibitors in treatment. a substantial percentage of infants, children and adolescents experience gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and its accompanying symptoms, as well as disease complications. the diagnosis of gerd in children is made based upon the child's history, and data derived primarily from ph monitoring tests and endoscopy. in those children with confirmed reflux disease, the options for management parallel those recommended in adult patients, with the first step consisting of lifestyle changes. surgical procedures may also be performed; however, these are rarely recommended prior to an adequate course of pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate case selection is important. among the current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the us, the prokinetic agents and the acid-inhibitory agents (histamine- receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are the most widely used. the clinical utility of the prokinetic agents has been limited by the recent withdrawal of cisapride from the us marketplace and the potential for irreversible central nervous system complications with metoclopramide. numerous clinical studies performed in adults, and several studies involving children, have demonstrated that the proton pump inhibitors are more effective than the histamine- receptor antagonists in the relief of gerd symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. in children, omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered as the intact oral capsule, or in those who are unable or unwilling to swallow, the granule contents of the capsule may be mixed with soft foods (e.g. apple sauce) or fruit drinks/liquid dietary supplements prior to oral administration with no detrimental effects on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, or pharmacodynamics. studies performed with omeprazole and lansoprazole in children have shown pharmacokinetic parameters that closely resemble those observed in adults. in over a decade of use in adults, the proton pump inhibitor class of agents has been found to have a good safety profile. studies involving children have also shown these agents to be well tolerated. in numerous drug-drug interaction studies performed with these two proton pump inhibitors, relatively few clinically significant interactions have been observed."
"short course of omeprazole: a better first diagnostic approach to noncardiac chest pain than endoscopy, manometry, or -hour esophageal ph monitoring. noncardiac chest pain (nccp) presents as a frequent diagnostic challenge, with patients tending to use a disproportionate level of health care resources. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is the most frequent cause of nccp."
"peptic-ulcer disease. the discovery of helicobacter pylori has greatly changed our approach to peptic ulcer disease. bacterial, host, and environmental factors all have a role in peptic-ulcer disease. although the prevalence of uncomplicated peptic ulcers is falling, hospital admissions for ulcer complications associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are rising. evidence suggests that prescription of nsaids along with potent antiulcer agents and the use of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase- inhibitors reduce gastroduodenal ulceration. whether these therapeutic advances will translate into clinical benefits remains to be seen. the interaction between h pylori and nsaids is one of the most controversial issues in peptic ulcer disease. with the fall in rates of h pylori infection, the proportion of ulcers not related to this organism and nsaids has risen, which will affect the management of peptic ulcer."

"motion--helicobacter pylori worsens gerd: arguments for the motion. there are several reasons for eradicating helicobacter pylori in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). perhaps the most compelling is the evidence that chronic acid suppression therapy can lead to the development of atrophic gastritis, a premalignant condition, in patients with h pylori infection. epidemiological data that suggest that h pylori is less prevalent in gerd patients than in control subjects may be susceptible to publication bias, and confounding social and environmental factors may also be involved. although it has been thought that eradication of the organism might lead to increased esophageal acid exposure, this has not been demonstrated in practice. studies that appeared to show that gerd could be provoked by antimicrobial therapy of duodenal ulcers also have methodological weaknesses. underlying gerd symptoms might be unmasked after withdrawal of acid-suppression therapy, for reasons that are unrelated to h pylori. in fact, eradication of the organism has been shown to decrease heartburn in patients with peptic ulcer disease. when h pylori is successfully eradicated in patients with gerd, relapse rates are not increased, and the disease-free interval seems to be prolonged. eradication of the organism is a wise policy in patients who face long term acid-suppression therapy for gerd."
"motion--helicobacter pylori causes or worsens gerd: arguments against the motion. data from large epidemiological studies show that helicobacter pylori is less prevalent in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) than in control subjects. the more virulent caga-positive strains of the organism are also less commonly seen in patients with erosive esophagitis and in those with barrett's esophagus than in those with less severe forms of gerd. although the relationship between h pylori and gastric physiology is complex, the organism has little effect on acid secretion in most north american or western european subjects, and has a net suppressive effect, especially in elderly subjects, in other parts of the world. thus, the organism has a potential protective effect against gerd, which is exacerbated by gastric acidity. h pylori has no proven effect on other gastric factors that might provoke reflux, including delayed gastric emptying or inappropriate relaxation of the gastric fundus. two well-designed interventional studies have found that eradication of h pylori either provoked gerd or had no effect. a third smaller study, which seemed to demonstrate that persistent infection was associated with gerd, was flawed, in that the two treatment groups were not comparable. the evidence thus does not support the idea that h pylori infection provokes or aggravates gerd."
"motion--laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is more cost effective than oral ppi administration: arguments against the motion. discussion of the cost effectiveness of medical and surgical treatments of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is plagued by a number of logical fallacies. several of these defects in reasoning are reviewed. for example, it is inappropriate to compare the costs of therapies unless they are equally effective. the relative cost effectiveness of various treatment options is difficult to determine because monetary expenditures and gains in health status cannot easily be measured in commensurate units. not everything can be translated into incremental cost effectiveness ratios. two decision analyses from european investigators seemed to show that nissen fundoplication was more cost effective than long term acid-suppression therapy, but they failed to consider the costs of surgical complications and failures. the most comprehensive decision analysis, employing a markov chain model, found that the two treatment options were roughly equivalent, at least during the first seven years of follow-up. decision analyses often do not reflect actual practice patterns and cannot provide solutions to problems that cannot be solved by appropriate medical reasoning. moreover, results that are reported by specialized surgical centres probably cannot be duplicated by less experienced surgeons. the increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been erroneously attributed to the use of potent acid-suppressant medications, but the actual cause has been shown to be the decreased prevalence of helicobacter pylori. there are no significant differences in the incidence of this tumour after medical or surgical therapy of gerd. it is unlikely, however, that arguments will convince proponents of one treatment or another to change their opinions."
"etiology of dyspepsia: implications for empirical therapy. dyspepsia describes a symptom complex thought to arise in the upper gastrointestinal tract and includes, in addition to epigastric pain or discomfort, symptoms such as heartburn, acid regurgitation, excessive burping or belching, a feeling of slow digestion, early satiety, nausea and bloating. based on the evidence that heartburn cannot be reliably distinguished from other dyspeptic symptoms, the rome definition appears to be too narrow and restrictive. it is particularly ill suited to the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia at the level of primary care. in patients presenting with uninvestigated dyspepsia, a symptom benefit is associated with a 'test and treat' approach for helicobacter pylori infection. a substantial proportion of those who do not benefit prove to have esophagitis on endoscopy. in those with functional dyspepsia, the benefits of h pylori eradication, if any, appear to be modest. hence, a 'symptom and treat' acid-suppression trial with proton pump inhibitors, and a 'test and treat' strategy for h pylori are two acceptable empirical therapies for patients with univestigated dyspepsia."

"does helicobacter pylori eradication affect symptoms in nonulcer dyspepsia: a -year follow-up study. the role of helicobacter pylori infection in nonulcer dyspepsia remains controversial. to date studies exploring the effect of h. pylori eradication on symptoms have reported conflicting results. randomised control trials employing validated outcome measures have also been difficult to interpret because of several important issues such as the large placebo response seen in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and both the natural variability in symptoms and symptom severity with time. the association of symptom improvement with resolution of gastritis has meant that the length of follow up employed in most studies has been insufficient. we report the findings of a randomised placebo controlled trial (n = ), using a validated symptom questionnaire and year follow up to determine the effect of h. pylori eradication on symptoms in nonulcer dyspepsia. in all that were reviewed at years there was a significant difference between patients who were h. pylori negative and those who remained positive with regard to complete symptom resolution, consumption of relevant medications and peptic ulcer disease development, in favour of active treatment. there was a trend for gradual symptom improvement over time irrespective of h. pylori status, which may reflect the natural history of this condition. for those who remained symptomatic at years, there was no difference in symptom severity based on h. pylori status. the findings of this study support the use of h. pylori eradication in symptomatic patients with nonulcer dyspepsia both to induce symptom resolution and to prevent disease progression."
"[differential diagnosis and therapy of acute pancreatitis]. acute pancreatitis is classified in an interstitial edematous pancreatitis and a hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis comprising % and % respectively of all cases. % of acute pancreatitis are attributed to biliary and alcoholic origin whereas in more than % no etiology can be established comprising the idiopathic forms of acute pancreatitis. clinical symptoms are rather unspecific resulting in a large number of abdominal and extraabdominal diseases that have to be considered regarding the differential diagnosis. diagnosis is based on clinical examination, laboratory findings and ultrasound. however it has to be taken into account that a lack of abdominal symptoms and unaltered amylase and lipase levels may be present in spite of overt pancreatitis. as severe pancreatitis is associated with a steep increase in mortality the early identification of severe pancreatitis is crucial. several prognostic scores like the ranson-, glasgow- and apache-ii score were developed to achieve a higher sensitivity detecting transition to severe pancreatitis. in addition new prognostic serum parameters are applicable. a prophylactic antibiotic therapy is recommended in patients with sterile necrosis whereas an infected necrosis requires organ preserving necrosectomy and retroperitoneal lavage which can be done surgically or referring to new concepts endoscopically. apart from renal and respiratory failure, necrosis, pseudocysts and pancreatic abscess are the main complications. in the presence of detected stones in the common bile tract ercp in combination with stone extraction and papillotomy reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with biliary pancreatitis. laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed as soon as the patient has recovered and preferably during the same hospital admission."
"short-term therapeutic trial of proton pump inhibitors in suspected extraesophageal reflux. pharyngoesophageal gastric acid reflux is thought to initiate chronic posterior laryngitis. the gold standard for measuring gastric reflux is dual-channel -hour ph monitoring. this is a time-consuming, inconvenient, expensive method that is not available in all areas. new therapeutic regimes that make use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) have proven to be therapeutically efficient for control of acid reflux. twenty-four consecutive patients with chronic voice disorders and signs of posterior laryngitis were selected for therapy. twenty-four hour ph monitoring was performed independently before the therapy. the trial therapy consisted of all patients receiving pantoprazole, mg once daily for weeks. immediately following the therapy a statistically significant (p < .) improvement was observed in all patients. this improvement was analyzed retrospectively by comparison with the results of -hour ph monitoring. in % of the patients the -hour ph-monitoring gave a positive result showing a high number of patients with extraesophageal reflux in our study group. patients with positive results of ph-monitoring responded in a statistically significant manner (p < .) to the pantoprazole therapy, whereas those patients without detected reflux did not. a -month follow-up of the patients with a positive result of the ph-monitoring confirmed the improvement. no patients reported adverse effects. a -week treatment with pantoprazole can be clinically justified. it helps to save time and reduce costs, allows for selection of reflux-negative patients for alternative therapy, and may prevent inadequate treatment of patients with false-negative ph monitoring. twenty-four hour ph monitoring is still recommended for patients unresponsive to this trial therapy."
"motion--laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is more cost effective than oral ppi administration: arguments for the motion. gastroesophageal reflux disease is a mechanical disorder of the foregut. while medications can only provide symptom relief, surgery can correct the pathophysiological abnormality of the lower esophageal sphincter. the costs of medical and surgical therapy are much greater than the costs of medication or hospitalization alone. in the case of medical therapy, one must consider the costs of serial monitoring and of failed treatment. the effectiveness of treatment also depends on patient-related factors, including weight, socioeconomic factors, smoking, alcohol use, dietary habits and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. surgical results depend on the experience and skill of the surgeon, as well as the attributes of the institution in which the procedure is undertaken. therefore, studies that come from specialized centres may not be applicable to the community. data from the author's facility indicate that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is the most cost effective option when it is undertaken by experienced surgeons on otherwise healthy patients who have documented gastroesophageal reflux disease."
"gastroesophageal reflux and cow milk allergy: is there a link? gastroesophageal reflux (ger) and cow milk allergy (cma) occur frequently in infants younger than year. in recent years, the relation between these entities has been investigated and some important conclusions have been reached: in up to half of the cases of ger in infants younger than year, there may be an association with cma. in a high proportion of cases, ger is not only cma associated but also cma induced. the frequency of this association should induce pediatricians to screen for possible concomitant cma in all infants who have ger and are younger than year. with the exception of some patients with mild typical cma manifestations (diarrhea, dermatitis, or rhinitis), the symptoms of ger associated with cma are the same as those observed in primary ger. immunologic tests and esophageal ph monitoring (with a typical ph pattern characterized by a progressive, slow decrease in esophageal ph between feedings) may be helpful if an association between ger and cma is suspected, although the clinical response to an elimination diet and challenge is the only clue to the diagnosis. this article reviews the main features of ger and cma, focusing on the aspects in common and the discrepancies between both conditions."
"the clinical importance of proton pump inhibitor pharmacokinetics. achieving the optimal clinical response for patients with upper gastrointestinal peptic disease is important. this response depends on the pathology treated as well as on the choice of proton pump inhibitor. here, we identify factors in specific disease therapy and proton pump inhibitor (ppi) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that help us achieve this goal. these include differences in ppi bioavailability and acid-suppressive effects. available data indicate that ppis appear to have similar potency on a milligram basis, and that omeprazole and lansoprazole are more frequently double dosed than pantoprazole. the lower propensity for double dosing with pantoprazole may also result in lower medication acquisition costs and a reduction in physician visits due to ineffective therapy with the standard dosing of these other agents."

esomeprazole: update and clinical review. the u.s. food and drug administration's nonprescription drugs advisory committee and gastroenterological drugs advisory committee recommended approval of omeprazole as an over-the-counter treatment of heartburn in patients who have at least two episodes of heartburn each week. the consumer studies that have been conducted indicate that the majority of patients understand the proposed labeling and could use the proposed label to determine if the omeprazole therapy was appropriate for them. esomeprazole is an effective agent in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and erosive esophagitis. newer studies continue to support its efficacy and safety in the treatment of these conditions. several of the most recent studies have included comparisons with other proton pump inhibitors. the results of these studies indicate that all the proton pump inhibitors are effective in treating gerd and erosive esophagitis and that some patients would benefit from esomeprazole therapy.

"pantoprazole: an update of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in the management of acid-related disorders. pantoprazole (protonix) is an irreversible proton pump inhibitor (ppi) that reduces gastric acid secretion. in combination with two antimicrobial agents (most commonly metronidazole, clarithromycin or amoxicillin) for - days, pantoprazole mg twice daily produced helicobacter pylori eradication rates of -.% (intent-to-treat [itt] or modified itt analysis) in patients without known antibacterial resistance. pantoprazole-containing triple therapy was at least as effective as omeprazole- and similar in efficacy to lansoprazole-containing triple therapy in large trials. in the treatment of moderate to severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord), oral pantoprazole mg/day was as effective as other ppis (omeprazole, omeprazole multiple unit pellet system, lansoprazole and esomeprazole) and significantly more effective than histamine h()-antagonists. pantoprazole mg/day provided effective mucosal healing in patients with gord and mild oesophagitis. intravenous pantoprazole mg/day can be used in patients who are unable to take oral medication. oral pantoprazole - mg/day for up to months prevented relapse in most patients with healed gord. according to preliminary data, oral pantoprazole or mg/day was effective at healing and preventing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid)-related ulcers, and intravenous pantoprazole was at least as effective as intravenous ranitidine in preventing ulcer rebleeding after endoscopic haemostasis. oral or intravenous pantoprazole up to mg/day maintained target acid output levels in most patients with hypersecretory conditions, including zollinger-ellison syndrome. oral and intravenous pantoprazole appear to be well tolerated in patients with acid-related disorders in short- and long-term trials. tolerability with oral pantoprazole was similar to that with other ppis or histamine h()-antagonists in short-term trials. formal drug interaction studies have not revealed any clinically significant interactions between pantoprazole and other agents. in conclusion, pantoprazole is an effective agent in the management of acid-related disorders. as a component of triple therapy for h. pylori eradication and as monotherapy for the healing of oesophagitis and maintenance of gord, pantoprazole has shown similar efficacy to other ppis and greater efficacy than histamine h()-antagonists. limited data suggest that it is also effective in zollinger-ellison syndrome and in preventing ulcer rebleeding. pantoprazole is well tolerated with minimal potential for drug interactions. the availability of pantoprazole as both oral and intravenous formulations provides flexibility when the oral route of administration is not appropriate. thus, pantoprazole is a valuable alternative to other ppis in the treatment of acid-related disorders."
"management of peptic ulcer disease not related to helicobacter pylori or nsaids. helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection is widely accepted as the most important factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer. however, in parallel with more effective eradication of h. pylori, the prevalence of h. pylori is changing, and h. pylori-negative peptic ulcer disease appears to be increasing. when making a diagnosis of h. pylori-negative peptic ulcer disease, it is essential to avoid misclassification because of inaccurate diagnosis. in addition, secondary causes may need to be excluded with appropriate investigations. in the absence of h. pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage is the most common cause of peptic ulcer; surreptitious nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage is a cause of unexplained ulcer disease in up to % of patients. hypersecretory syndromes such as zollinger-ellison syndrome, although rare, need to be excluded. once all known etiological factors are excluded, there remains a group of patients with so-called ""idiopathic ulcers."" the interplay of etiological factors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic peptic ulcer disease is poorly defined but may include a genetic predisposition, altered acid secretion, rapid gastric emptying, defective mucosal defense mechanisms, psychological stress, and smoking. the management of idiopathic peptic ulcers is not defined; they appear to be more resistant to standard therapy, can be associated with more frequent complications, and those that relapse may require long-term maintenance therapy."

"motion--genetic testing is useful in the diagnosis of nonhereditary pancreatic conditions: arguments against the motion. mutations of two genes, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (cftr) and the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (psti), are associated with an increase in the risk of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. persons who have mutations of both cftr alleles (one severely and one mildly affected) are especially susceptible to this disease. because these compound heterozygotes have sufficient residual cftr function, they do not develop cystic fibrosis lung disease. one psti mutation, ns, independently increases the risk of pancreatitis. thus, the risk of pancreatitis is greatest among individuals who are cftr compound heterozygotes and who also have the psti mutation. nonetheless, most people with cftr and psti mutations do not develop pancreatitis. this fact indicates that environmental influences and gene-gene interactions also affect pancreatitis risk. although cftr and psti genetic testing can identify persons at an increased risk of pancreatitis, there are several reasons why the routine screening of individuals with nonhereditary pancreatitis is not recommended at this time: most disease-associated mutations are not detected by readily available techniques, genetic counselling guidelines do not exist, most patients with mutations do not develop pancreatitis and the results of testing do not affect the clinical management of pancreatitis."
"reflux disease and barrett's esophagus. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorders. the key feature of gerd is reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. medical treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (ppis) is well established and is considered the standard treatment. given the high prevalence of the condition and the excellent response to medical therapy, antireflux surgery is an option for patients with volume reflux that is not properly controlled by medical therapy. adenocarcinoma is a rare but life-threatening complication of gerd. the only known precursor lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma is barrett's esophagus. in recent years, a clearer understanding of the development of barrett's and of its progression toward invasive cancer has developed. genetic factors almost certainly determine the individual risk. the length of the barrett's esophagus segment and the size of a hiatal hernia are associated with the risk of developing high-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma.with regard to the clinical management of gerd patients with barrett's, endoscopic surveillance at -year intervals is now considered appropriate in the absence of dysplasia. in patients with high-grade dyspepsia, the situation is more difficult. while a considerable proportion of these patients may already have invasive cancers, there is also the possibility that there is only focal dysplasia. for this reason, it is justifiable to carry out curative endoscopic resection. mucosal ablation procedures may also be appropriate, but these still need to be properly investigated in clinical trials."

"gastroesophageal reflux disease. heartburn on or more days a week warrants medical attention, as patients are likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). chronic gerd can lead to the development of complications including erosive esophagitis, stricture formation, and barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. a trial with a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) is the quickest and most cost-effective way to diagnose gerd, and is at least as sensitive as -hour intra-esophageal ph monitoring. as ppis only bind to actively secreting proton pumps, they should be dosed to minutes before a meal. despite these recommendations, a recent survey of over us primary care physicians found that % instructed their patients to take a ppi with or after a meal or did not specify the timing of dosing. the patients who will have the best response to surgical therapy for gerd are those who had clearly documented acid reflux with typical symptoms, and who have responded to ppi treatment. unfortunately, the same survey found that most physicians recommend antireflux surgery for patients in whom medical therapy has failed."
"review article: esomeprazole--enhanced bio-availability, specificity for the proton pump and inhibition of acid secretion. esomeprazole, the s-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor available for clinical use as a single isomer. it demonstrates pharmacological and clinical benefits beyond those seen with the racemic omeprazole. esomeprazole has higher and more consistent bio-availability than omeprazole, which results in a greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve. it is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of omeprazole and esomeprazole that determines how much of each reaches the parietal cell, and thus the control of gastric acid secretion that is achieved. esomeprazole, like other proton pump inhibitors, has a high specificity for the acidic environment of the parietal cell, where it is accumulated, activated and covalently inhibits the proton pump. proton pumps elsewhere in the body do not achieve the level of acidity needed for accumulation and activation. esomeprazole, mg once daily, provides more effective control of gastric acid secretion than omeprazole, or mg once daily, and all other proton pump inhibitors given at their standard doses. this translates into greater clinical effect compared with omeprazole, mg once daily, and lansoprazole, mg once daily, in the management of reflux disease. esomeprazole therapy is well tolerated, with a low adverse events profile, similar to that seen with omeprazole."

"endoluminal therapies for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) is a common chronic disorder that has severe impact on quality of life and often requires continuous acid-suppression therapy. proton-pump inhibitors (ppis) are extremely effective but expensive, and do not restore the normal antireflux barrier at the gastro-oesophageal junction. antireflux surgery, even with the laparoscopic approach, has not proven more cost-effective than maintenance therapy with ppis. postoperative morbidity is substantial, especially when procedures are done outside expert centres. in the past few years several endoscopic techniques have been developed to treat chronic gord on an outpatient basis. these techniques include radiofrequency-energy delivery and endoscopic suturing, although other approaches are now under development. staring point: two prospective open-label studies have recently reported -year follow-up of gord patients treated either by radiofrequency-energy delivery (g triadafilopoulos and colleagues gastrointest endosc ; :-) or endoscopic suturing (z mahmood and colleagues gut ; :-). in a us multicentre trial, triadafilopoulos and colleagues delivered radiofrequency energy to the cardia and distal oesophagus in patients with chronic heartburn, regurgitation or both (the stretta procedure). all patients were on continuous acid-suppression therapy, but none had severe oesophagitis or hiatus hernia of more than cm. at months, patients available for follow-up showed significant improvement in gord symptoms, quality of life, and oesophageal acid-exposure. the need for ppi therapy fell from % to % of patients. in the mahmood study, similar patients had endoscopic suturing in a single centre. after year, symptoms and quality of life improved and the need for ppis was reduced to % from %. in both studies, only minor complications occurred, none of which required specific therapeutic intervention. where next? an effective outpatient procedure to treat chronic gord would represent a major step forward. however, further studies are needed before an endoscopic approach can be adopted, as none of the published trials are well-controlled studies. longer follow-up is needed to ensure that relapses do not occur rapidly, complications do not occur more frequently with less skilled operators, or that endoscopic-induced changes do not complicate or compromise subsequent antireflux surgery. comparative studies of the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic therapy should also include medical strategies such as intermittent or on-demand ppi therapy."

"helicobacter pylori infection and perforated peptic ulcer prevalence of the infection and role of antimicrobial treatment. although the role of helicobacter pylori infection on noncomplicated peptic ulcer disease has been definitively established, the precise relationship between the organism and complicated ulcer has hardly been studied. the mean prevalence of h. pylori infection in patients with perforated peptic ulcer is of only about -%, which contrasts with the almost -% figure reported in noncomplicated ulcer disease. however, h. pylori infection rates in various studies range markedly from % to %, suggesting that differences in variables as number and type of diagnostic methods used to diagnose h. pylori infection, or frequency of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake, may be responsible for the low prevalence reported in some studies. recurrent ulcer disease after peptic ulcer perforation mainly occurs in patients with h. pylori infection, which suggests that the microorganism plays an important role in this complication. all patients with perforated peptic ulcer should be treated by simple closure of the perforation and with therapy aimed at healing of the ulcer and eradicating the h. pylori infection, as disappearance of the organism prevents, or at least decreases, ulcer recurrence and ulcer perforation in patients with h. pylori-associated perforated ulcers after simple closure. therefore, h. pylori eradicating treatment should be started during the immediate postoperative period. the patients with intractable recurrent symptoms of peptic ulcer despite adequate medical treatment, but without h. pylori infection (e.g. a patient using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), is probably the only remaining indication for elective definitive surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease."

"motion--cyclo-oxygenase- selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are as safe as placebo for the stomach: arguments against the motion. cyclo-oxygenase (cox) exists in two isoforms, cox- and cox-, that direct the synthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane. traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit both isoenzymes, resulting in damage to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, but also in cardioprotection. selective cox- inhibitors are less likely to damage the upper gastrointestinal tract, as has been shown by large, randomized, controlled trials. specifically, the newer agents are superior to ibuprofen and naproxen in this regard, but celecoxib and diclofenac were not significantly different in patients who were not also taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. these studies did not include a placebo arm, however, and controlled comparisons of cox- inhibitors with placebo have not enlisted enough subjects to demonstrate conclusively that they are equally safe. selectivity for the cox- isoform affords protection against upper gastrointestinal toxicity possibly at the expense of the cardioprotective effect of traditional nsaids. this might explain the higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who are given rofecoxib compared with naproxen. a traditional nsaid, combined with either misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor, is still a suitable alternative to selective cox- inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis."

"review article: management of mild and severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. treatment of endosocopy-negative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (s-gerd) should be directed towards rapid relief of symptoms and then maintenance of relief using minimum yet effective therapy. responses to proton pump inhibitors are somewhat lower in s-gerd patients compared to gerd with overt erosive damage (e-gerd). the reasons for a lower response rate are not clear but may relate to the inclusion of patients who do not have reflux disease or patients with a lower oesophageal sensory threshold. also poorly understood is the lower yield of complete heartburn relief when the number of associated dyspeptic symptoms is high. some form of long-term therapy is needed in the majority of patients. 'on demand' proton pump inhibitor therapy to control reflux symptoms is a new and attractive option. time to study discontinuation due to insufficient control of heartburn, or any other reason resulting in unwillingness to continue with on-demand therapy, is a pragmatic outcome that is well suited to definition of the efficacy of on-demand therapy. the goals of treatment of e-gerd should be to relieve symptoms and to heal lesions. symptom severity and much less endoscopic abnormalities drives the therapeutic choices. when symptoms are mild or intermittent and when oesophagitis is of limited degree, standard dose proton pump inhibitor is usually instituted. fewer and fewer clinicians would still opt for an h-receptor antagonist. if there is moderate or severe oesophagitis or if symptoms are particularly troublesome, then the patient should start with standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy once a day, but not uncommonly a b.d. dosage maybe necessary. once the dose of the acid suppressant that relieves symptoms is found, this dose should be maintained for a period of months. after this time, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose. if symptoms recur, then the patients should go back to the full-dose proton pump inhibitor and a plan should be formulated for long-term treatment. the long-term treatment options vary between ongoing acid and suppressant therapy, with occasional attempts to reduce the dose, or to go for 'on demand' therapy and (rarely) includes consideration for surgery or endoscopic anti-reflux therapy."

"overview of medical therapy for gastroesophageal disease. the last twenty years have seen an evolution of much improved strategies in the medical treatment of gerd. current therapy is targeted at acid suppression, to deal with consequences of mucosal injury and afford resolution of symptoms. given their modest efficacy, there is no longer much support for initial treatment with hras. ppis have been shown to provide the highest levels of symptom relief and esophageal healing, in addition to preventing relapse and complications. with this class of agents, the clinician is able to prescribe a drug that is as highly effective as surgery for the purpose intended, without worrying about long term sequelae of acid suppression. it appears that patients with extraesophageal gerd must be treated with higher doses of pharmacologic therapy, principally with the ppis, for longer periods of time to achieve complete relief of symptoms when compared to patients with heartburn and erosive esophagitis. there is still no clear consensus as to whether aggressive acid suppression alters the natural history of barrett's esophagus. based on their initial success, it appears that the next generation of evolving medical therapies will continue to play an important role in the management of gerd. the outcome from medical therapy is the standard against which the results of the novel endoscopy anti-reflux treatments will be measured."
"an overview of the success and failure of surgical therapy: standards against which the outcome of endoscopic therapy is measured. medical therapy for reflux disease has evolved from frequent antacid use to once daily proton pump inhibitor therapy. despite the efficacy of these agents in healing erosive esophagitis, there are several short-comings with medical therapy including incomplete symptom relief, the need for continuous maintenance therapy, and cost. endoscopic and laparoscopic treatments for reflux disease are appealing because they could reduce or eliminate the need for chronic maintenance therapy with medications. while there is evidence of high quality on the efficacy of medical therapy from randomized controlled trials, data on endoscopic procedures and surgery is more limited. this article summarizes the needed studies and the standards against which these procedures should be measured."
"gatekeeper reflux repair system: technique, pre-clinical, and clinical experience. the gatekeeper reflux repair system is a new, promising endoscopic anti-reflux therapy. it has now been shown that it is possible to implant hydrogel prosthesis in the submucosa of the esophagus of humans. the pilot study in humans showed that it is a safe technique and no prostheses migrated into the mediastinum. with the help of endoscopic ultrasonography, each prosthesis was followed during the -month pilot study. after finishing this pilot study, new multi-center studies have been initiated with implantation of more prostheses to increase efficacy. one of the definite advantages over the other endoscopic treatments currently being developed is its reversibility. regarding endoscopic anti-reflux therapy in general, it is important to stress that at this time no data are available in the literature about the comparison to medical therapy. at the same time long-term results are also unknown. for these reasons these endoscopic procedures must be considered experimental and they should be performed in a clinical research setting. within a few years the role of the gatekeeper reflux repair system will be better understood for those ppi-dependent gerd-patients who wish to stop their medication."
"endoscopic implantation of enteryx for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: technique, pre-clinical and clinical experience. the implantation of enteryx polymer in the les is a fast, minimally invasive procedure with anticipated low procedural risks and limited costs. preliminary clinical data after months of follow-up show good results in more than % of the patients, with objective improvement of acid reflux time. enteryx is effective in the management of gerd, as evidenced by the ability of gerd patients with a history of use of ppis and other gerd medications to eliminate or significantly reduce use of these medications. mechanisms of action of enteryx implantation suggest a change in distensibility of the les, allowing a greater competency of the cardia. les pressure and length might be increased after polymer implantation, and further studies are needed to study the effect of enteryx on transient relaxations of the les, which is the prevalent mechanism of reflux in patients with mild gerd. challenges with this procedure include refining technique to deliver adequate volume in each patient and determining if the ring-shaped implant is needed. in addition to acid reflux, another indication for use of this treatment might be biliary reflux in gastrectomized patients; preliminary data suggest that enteryx may reduce symptoms and improve bile reflux (j. devire, unpublished observations, ). further studies are needed to definitively establish the safety of the procedure. this is a major point because gastroenterologists are not dealing with ill patients but primarily with individuals who have a good quality of life while taking ppis. the other area to investigate is the efficacy of the treatment through a sham-controlled study. finally, this endoscopic technique will have to be evaluated in terms of cost-effectiveness against medical and surgical therapies."

"evaluation and management of patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations: a systematic review. this systematic review examines the evidence for commonly employed strategies of managing patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations. particular attention is given to recent evidence relating helicobacter pylori (h. pylori ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) to ulcer recurrence after operative therapy. medline word searches of the literature from to identified articles that cross-reference the terms ""peptic ulcer disease (pud),"" ""surgery,"" and ""recurrence."" articles were selected for systematic review of evidence relating incomplete vagotomy, nsaids, and h. pylori to postoperative ulcer recurrence and evidence supporting common medical and surgical strategies. the relationship between incomplete vagotomy and recurrent ulcer disease is suggested by randomized controlled trials and well-designed prospective case series. the evidence that nsaid use is an important pathogenic factor in recurrent ulcer disease includes the relationship between nsaids and primary pud, the occurrence of nsaid-induced ulcers in patients taking proton pump inhibitors, and case series demonstrating virulent ulcer disease in patients taking aspirin despite prior acid-reducing operations. the relationship between h. pylori infection and postoperative ulcer recurrence remains uncertain despite multiple controlled trials and well-designed case series that have documented high rates of h. pylori infection in postoperative patients. the initial management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of a protein pump inhibitor or a histamine- receptor antagonist and antibiotics directed at h. pylori, if present. evidence for this regimen includes prospective randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of cimetidine in healing ulcers after acid-reducing operations and prospective, randomized studies documenting the efficacy of histamine- receptor antagonists and protein pump inhibitors in the management of patients with primary pud. the critical role that h. pylori infection plays in primary pud and the minimal risks associated with h. pylori eradication strongly support the initiation of antibiotic therapy when h. pylori is present. the principal indication for operative management of recurrent pud is the occurrence of ulcer complications that cannot be managed by medical or endoscopic means. the operative management of patients with failed acid-reducing operations is based on ulcer recurrence rates and morbidity and mortality rates in randomized and nonrandomized prospective trials of patients with primary pud and retrospective case series of patients undergoing remedial operative procedures after various failed acid-reducing operations."
"gerd -- a consensus on the way ahead. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) has in recent times become an important public health issue owing to the considerable health care resources utilized in its management, its deleterious effect on quality of life and the increasing prevalence of a relatively rare complication of reflux disease - esophageal adenocarcinoma. we review here the major current challenges in the field of reflux disease and its complications, and provide some approaches that may be useful in management. the issues to be faced include the very limited comprehension of the reasons behind the increasing prevalence of the disease, difficulties in correlating symptoms with objective data of pathological gastroesophageal reflux and the relatively unsophisticated tools we are employing to investigate the underlying pathophysiology. it is certain that the lack of well-defined and characterized methodologies to compare the effects of therapy require the development of more effective questionnaire-type analytic tools. in regard to treatment, there is little doubt that the widely prescribed proton pump inhibitors have dose-equivalent efficacy and are the most highly effective agents capable of suppressing acid, controlling many of the symptoms of gerd and healing erosions. nevertheless, many patients continue to experience symptoms on withdrawal or at night. pharmacological agents that can effectively increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure or promote motility are as yet unavailable. although the introduction of laparoscopic techniques has resulted in a modest revival in surgical intervention using a variety of 'wrap-type' operations, the indications are few and the procedure is associated with a significant morbidity and even mortality especially if the expertise of the surgeon is an issue. endoscopic techniques of regulating reflux are at this time experimental and not applicable to the general population. intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus is probably very common. whether and how to, first, screen for, and then, perform surveillance in barrett's esophagus remains highly problematic and contentious."

"noncardiac chest pain: evaluation and treatment. noncardiac chest pain is a heterogeneous condition for which diagnosis and treatment are challenging. research is needed to streamline evaluation to minimize unnecessary invasive testing and costs. chest pain clinics to assess chest pain patients are popular in the united states and may be of value in reassuring patients and reducing presentation to hospital; however, recently this has been contended []. options for the effective treatment of nccp are dependent on the risk of an adverse outcome and the cost-effectiveness of the management algorithm that is followed. most (%) of those presenting to the emergency department with chest pain are classified as having nccp [,]. gerd is probably the most important cause and application of a test of acid suppression with a high-dose ppi for to weeks seems to be a useful diagnostic tool. in those patients with gerd-related nccp, short-term and potentially long-term therapy with a ppi (commonly higher than standard dose) is required to alleviate symptoms. esophageal dysmotility is relatively uncommon in patients with nccp and evaluation by esophageal manometry might be limited to rule out achalasia. chest wall syndromes are common but probably often missed. many patients with nccp have psychologic or psychiatric abnormalities, as either the cause or an effect of the chest pain, but diagnosis here depends on techniques not applied easily in the acute situation. pain modulators seem to offer significant improvement in chest pain symptoms for non-gerd-related nccp. finally, trials of management strategies to deal with this problem are required urgently, because the earlier discharge of patients with nccp may exacerbate the problem. fig. provides a flow chart for diagnosis and treatment of nccp."
"functional dyspepsia: evaluation and treatment. functional dyspepsia is one of the most common disorders seen in general practice and by gastroenterologists. new concepts regarding the pathophysiology and its role for the symptom pattern have emerged during the last few years. this is of importance for development of new treatment alternatives in the near future. at the moment, however, empirical treatment with acid-suppressive agents and prokinetics is the recommended therapeutic approach in the management of these patients, despite limited efficacy. identification and treatment of h pylori infection has been recommended for uninvestigated dyspepsia, because it may cure underlying peptic ulcer disease, but is unlikely to provide symptomatic benefit to patients with functional dyspepsia. refractory patients may respond to antidepressants or to psychologic treatments, but proof of efficacy is limited. new and more effective approaches are badly needed for functional dyspepsia."
"[four different treatment protocols for helicobacter pylori infection--a clinical pilot study]. a pilot clinical trial specially designed to test four different treatment regimens of helicobacter pylori infection was performed among hospitalized and outpatient based patients in clinical centre university of sarajevo, gastroenterohepatology clinics. another objective was to assess helicobacter pylori total cradication rates, partial cradication rates and after treatment persistent helicobacter pylori infection rates among patients with clinically proven peptic ulcer disease (pus). all patients randomly assigned into four groups had endoscopically and helicourcasa test (hut astra) proven peptic ulcers. each group was treated with one of the following four triple regimens: ranitidine + amoxicillin + metronidazole (ram); ranitidine + clarithromycin + metronidazole (rcm); omeprazole + amoxicillin + metronidazole (oam) and omeprazole + clarithromycin + m etronidazole (ocm). all triple regimens were given twice-a-day for one week following either ranitidine or omeprazole for two weeks depending of basic regimens. the highest helicobacter pylori eradication was produced with ocm regimens (.%). using same regimens we found the lowest partial eradication rate of all regimens (.%) and no persistency of h. pylori after the treatment. the lowest total eradication rate was found using rcm regimens (.%), while there was no difference in the cure rate between oam (.%) and ram (.%) regimens. if it is applicable, recommended treatment regimen as a first choice for proven h. pylori infection is ocm."
"the impact of treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease on health-related quality of life: a literature review. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) is common in the general population and is diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms and clinical tests. although clinical tests are available, significant percentages of patients report symptoms of heartburn and reflux despite negative endoscopies, and -hour ph tests are not often used by primary-care physicians in diagnosis. consequently, patient-reported symptoms and health-related qol (hr-qol) are important in assessing treatment outcome. hr-qol is significantly impaired in patients with gord, and hr-qol is associated with symptom severity and changes in gord-related symptoms. the objective of this literature review is to examine the impact of pharmacological treatment on hr-qol in patients with gord. generic and disease-specific hr-qol measures have been used in clinical trials to evaluate the impact of gord on patient functioning and well-being. the psychological general well-being (pgwb) index and the -item short-form health survey (sf-) have been used in several clinical trials of treatment for gord and have consistently shown that hr-qol improves with successful therapy. these trials have been conducted primarily with two pharmacological agents, omeprazole and ranitidine. on the heartburn-specific quality of life questionnaire, patients treated with ranitidine reported better hr-qol after treatment compared with placebo therapy. in two clinical trials where omeprazole and ranitidine were compared, patients treated with omeprazole reported significantly better hr-qol (based on the pgwb index) than those treated with ranitidine; however, other trials did not detect significant differences between the treatments. results from clinical trials using disease-specific measures (gastrointestinal quality of life index [giqli] and heartburn-specific quality of life questionnaire) demonstrate similar findings, supporting the association between treatment-related symptom resolution and improvements in hr-qol. the giqli was used in a trial comparing pantoprazole and ranitidine, where results favoured pantoprazole therapy. several studies have demonstrated that resolution of gord symptoms is associated with improvement in hr-qol. although there is evidence that treatment for gord does improve symptoms and hr-qol outcomes, further research is needed to more completely understand the value of medical therapy for gord."

"[treatment strategies for gastroesophageal reflux disease]. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a very common disorder. therapeutic options include lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, laparoscopic antireflux surgery, and three more recent options-injection therapy to the lower esophageal sphincter, endoscopic sewing procedures, and radio frequency ablation therapy. medical therapy is effective in most patients but not always successful with advanced disease. up to % of subjects do not have adequate nocturnal control of gastric acid secretion with mg of omeprazole given twice per day. patients who do not tolerate medical therapy, who respond inadequately, or who want to avoid life-long drug therapy are candidates for alternate treatments. studies on endoscopic procedures such as polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) injection, the stretta procedure,and endoscopic suturing techniques all suffer from having small study groups for each procedure,unknown durability, short follow-up, and the absence of randomized, controlled procedures. limitations on endoscopic techniques are esophageal motility disorders, severe esophagitis, and larger hiatal hernias. laparoscopic antireflux surgery remains a well-established, durable alternative to long-term medical therapy. it has the benefits of convenience, safety, minimal complications, improved quality of life, and low cost. alternative methods will have to earn their place against this gold standard."
low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications in a cohort of high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin or nsaids and omeprazole. there is very little information available on the incidence of complications and on the best prevention therapy in high-risk patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and/or aspirin. randomized-controlled trials in such patients are rare for ethical reasons. we studied the incidence of gastrointestinal complications in high-risk patients taking long-term low-dose aspirin or non-aspirin-nsaids combined with omeprazole in a real-life clinical setting.

"assessment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) damage in the human gastrointestinal tract. aspirin is widely prescribed and confers considerable benefit to patients by reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are effective analgesics, antipyretics and reduce the inflammatory component in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. however, both agents are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal symptoms and the potentially serious consequences of gastroduodenal ulceration, bleeding and perforation. the introduction of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase (cox)- inhibitors or the coprescription gastroprotective agents with nonselective nsaids have offered strategies to reduce the incidence of such events. this review article analyzes the quantitative techniques that can be employed by clinical pharmacologists and the clinical studies performed to assess nsaid damage in the gastrointestinal tract."
"treatment and prevention of aspirin-induced gastroduodenal ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. aspirin use is associated with gastroduodenal mucosal damage and increased risk of upper gastrointestinal (gi) bleeding. many aspirin users should receive prophylactic treatment since they often have several risk factors for upper gi complications. the best therapeutic approach for reducing gi toxicity in low-dose aspirin users is still ill-defined as only a few studies have focused on this problem. omeprazole appears to be very effective in reducing both acute gastroduodenal mucosal damage and upper gi bleeding in the high-risk patient taking low-dose aspirin, but data with other anti-ulcer agents are lacking (misoprostol) or inconsistent (ranitidine) at present. the role of helicobacter pylori is controversial in nsaid users, but there is now wide agreement that h. pylori infection increases mucosal damage and the risk of upper gi bleeding in low-dose aspirin users."

"current consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of h. pylori-associated gastroduodenal disease. helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a spiral shaped bacterium that resides in the stomach mucosa. isolation of h. pylori from the stomach mucosa changed the erstwhile widely held belief that the stomach contains no bacteria and is actually sterile. once h. pylori is safely ensconced in the mucus, it is able to neutralize the acid in the stomach by elaborating an enzyme called urease. urease converts urea, of which there is an abundant supply in the stomach (derived from saliva and the gastric juice), into bicarbonate and ammonia, which are strong bases. these bases form a cloud of acid-neutralizing chemicals in the vicinity of the organisms, protecting them from the acid in the stomach. this urea hydrolysis reaction is utilized for the diagnosis of h. pylori infection in the urea breath test (ubt) and the rapid urease test (rut). in japan, both invasive tests, such as bacterial culture, histopathology and rut, and non-invasive tests such as ubt and serology are conducted for the diagnosis of h. pylori infection. for confirming the results of eradication therapy, ubt is considered to be the most sensitive and specific. in order to treat h. pylori infection, a new one-week triple therapy regimen (lansoprazole or omeprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin) has been approved for use in patients with peptic ulcer disease in japan. as for h. pylori eradication in the case of other diseases in which the bacterium has been implicated (e.g., chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric malt lymphoma, gastric cancer, non-ulcer dyspepsia, chronic urticaria, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (itp)), further basic and clinical investigation is required."

"gastroesophageal reflux disease at the turn of millennium. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) has been an area of active research in the asia-pacific region in the recent years. this article outlines some of the interesting research findings. it comprises three parts. the first part dealt with recent data on the changing epidemiology of gerd in asia. the second part summarized published studies on the relationship between gerd and helicobacter pylori, relevant to the asia-pacific region. the last part discussed some of the recent advances in the treatment of gerd."
"belching: dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease? eructation (belching) is a common symptom seen in clinical practice. because either belching or heartburn may result from transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, it has been proposed that belching may be a manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). in this retrospective study we evaluated the prevalence of belching in dyspepsia and gerd and the relation of belching to acid reflux events documented by ph monitoring."

"an overview of proton pump inhibitors. proton pump inhibitors are the standard of treatment for acid-related disorders. these disorders include gastroesophageal reflux disease and its complications (i.e., erosive esophagitis and barrett's esophagus), peptic ulcer disease, zollinger-ellison syndrome, and idiopathic hypersecretion. proton pump inhibitors are also successfully used for the treatment of helicobacter pylori infection and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. there are currently five proton pump inhibitors approved by the food and drug administration and available in the united states. these are omeprazole (prilosec), lansoprazole (prevacid), rabeprazole (aciphex), pantoprazole (protonix), and esomeprazole (nexium). this review discusses the history of proton pump inhibitors and compares and evaluates the pharmacology including mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, administration, dosage, and drug interactions. information regarding therapeutic indications, clinical efficacy, short- and long-term side effects, and cost is also presented. a case presentation offers an analysis of the use of proton pump inhibitors in individualized patient care."
"gastroesophageal reflux disease: clinical manifestations. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is generally a lifelong illness that affects many people, but its significance is often underestimated. chronic abnormal gastric reflux results in erosive esophagitis in up to % of patients with gerd. esophageal stricture, barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma are the most serious complications of gerd. although heartburn and acid regurgitation are the most common complaints, extraesophageal symptoms such as noncardiac chest pain, laryngitis, coughing, and wheezing can be manifestations of gerd. unfortunately, the severity of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of the severity of erosive esophagitis. endoscopy is the preferred method to diagnose and grade erosive esophagitis, and various classification systems are used to grade disease severity. the los angeles classification is a valid and widely accepted system to evaluate the severity of erosive esophagitis. the immediate goals of treatment are to provide effective symptomatic relief and to achieve healing in patients with esophageal damage. the treatment regimen often begins by prescribing a therapy to reduce gastric acid secretion. a proton pump inhibitor is the preferred agent for many patients. because gerd is a chronic, relapsing disease, long-term maintenance therapy is usually necessary to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve the quality of life in patients with gerd."
gastroprotection by coxibs: what do the celecoxib long-term arthritis safety study and the vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research trial tell us? current evidence suggests that ppis might be effective in maintaining patients in remission during continued nsaid use and that the combination of omeprazole plus diclofenac is as effective as treatment with celecoxib in preventing recurrent bleeding. larger outcome studies comparing the combination of a ppi with other nonselective nsaids and a selective cox- inhibitor (and the combination of a selective cox- inhibitor with a ppi or misoprostol) are required to determine whether or not any regimen will further decrease or eliminate the risk of ulcer complications in high-risk individuals.

"extraesophageal manifestations of gerd. the association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and extraesophageal disease is often referred to as extraesophageal reflux (eer). this article reviews eer, discussing epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment with a focus on the most studied and convincing eer disorders-asthma, cough, and laryngitis. although eer comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders, some general characterizations can be made, as follows. first, although gerd's association with extraesophageal diseases is well-established, definitive evidence of causation has been more elusive, rendering epidemiological data scarce. secondly, regarding the pathogenesis of eer, basic models have been proposed: direct injury to extraesophageal tissue by acid and pepsin exposure or injury mediated through an esophageal reflex mechanism. third, because heartburn and regurgitation are often absent in patients with eer, gerd may not be suspected. even when gerd is suspected, the diagnosis may be difficult to confirm. although endoscopy and barium esophagram remain important tools for detecting esophageal complications, they may fail to establish the presence of gerd. even when gerd is diagnosed by endoscopy or barium esophagram, causation between gerd and extraesophageal symptoms cannot be determined. esophageal ph is the most sensitive tool for detecting gerd, and it plays an important role in eer. however, even ph testing cannot establish gerd's causative relationship to extraesophageal symptoms. in this regard, effective treatment of gerd resulting in significant improvement or remission of the extraesophageal symptoms provides the best evidence for gerd's pathogenic role. finally, eer generally requires more prolonged and aggressive antisecretory therapy than typical gerd requires."
"management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment. simple lifestyle modifications are the first methods employed by patients and, because of their low cost and simplicity, should be continued even when more potent therapies are initiated. potent acid-suppressive therapy is currently the most important and successful medical therapy. whereas healing of the esophageal mucosa is achieved with a single dose of any proton pump inhibitor (ppi) in more than % of cases, symptoms are more difficult to control. patients with persistent symptoms on therapy should be tested (preferably with combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and ph) for association of symptoms with acid, nonacid, or no ger. long-term follow-up studies indicate that ppis are efficacious, tolerable, and safe medication. so far, promotility agents have shown limited efficacy, and their side-effect profile outweighs their benefits. antireflux surgery in carefully selected patients (ie, young, typical gerd symptoms, abnormal ph study, and good response to ppi) is as effective as ppi therapy and should be offered to these patients as an alternative to medication. still, patients should be informed about the risks of antireflux surgery (ie, risk of postoperative dysphagia; decreased ability to belch, possibly leading to bloating; increased flatulence). endoscopic antireflux procedures are recommended only in selected patients and given the relative short experience with these techniques, patients treated with endoscopic procedures should be enrolled in a rigorous follow-up program."
"a comparison of intravenous ranitidine and omeprazole on gastric volume and ph in women undergoing emergency caesarean section. we have compared the effect of intravenously administered omeprazole and ranitidine on gastric contents in a double-blind study in consecutive women undergoing emergency caesarean section. when the decision to perform emergency caesarean section was made, patients were randomly assigned to receive either ranitidine mg or omeprazole mg intravenously. the volume and ph of the gastric contents were measured immediately after tracheal intubation and again before extubation. the gastric ph was found to be higher after omeprazole than after ranitidine immediately after intubation (. +/- . and . +/- . respectively) (p < .) and before extubation (. +/- . and . +/- . respectively) (p < .). however, the gastric volumes were comparable in both the groups. the number of patients with gastric volume > ml and ph < . were (.%) in the ranitidine group and (.%) in the omeprazole group after intubation and none in either of the groups before extubation. we conclude that omeprazole mg iv administered at the time of the decision to operate, results in higher gastric ph than ranitidine in obstetric patients undergoing emergency caesarean section."
"omeprazole/amoxicillin versus triple therapy for helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer disease: two-year follow-up of a prospective randomized study. the present study was designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of triple therapy and dual therapy for helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer patients and to evaluate the long-term clinical course of ulcer disease. forty duodenal ulcer patients with proven h. pylori infection were enrolled into the study and randomly treated with either triple therapy consisting of bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole and tetracycline plus ranitidine or with dual therapy comprising omeprazole and amoxicillin. patients were investigated clinically and endoscopically including assessment of h. pylori infection by means or rapid urease test, culture, histology and urea breath testing weeks after cessation of eradication therapy, in -year intervals and when dyspeptic symptoms recurred. one patient of each group was lost during follow-up. h. pylori infection was cured by triple therapy in .% and by dual therapy in .% (p = .). during follow-up, all patients with cure of h. pylori infection (n = ) remained in stable remission with respect to duodenal ulcer disease, while out of patients persistently infected with h. pylori developed an ulcer relapse (p < .). one patient with cured infection had had an episode of dyspeptic symptoms requiring pharmacotherapy and in another patients mild refluxesophagitis without necessity of medical treatment had been detected on the occasion of a scheduled endoscopy. in the short-term, cure of the infection resulted in a marked reduction of the degree of antral gastritis and in a loss of activity in all but one patient.(abstract truncated at words)."
"use of pcr with feces for detection of helicobacter pylori infections in patients. pcr was performed for the detection of helicobacter pylori in feces from patients with proven infections. several precautions were taken to overcome possible inhibition of pcr with feces. in the first patients, feces were examined shortly after endoscopy. in another group of patients, who were treated during weeks with omeprazole ( mg each day) to increase gastric ph, feces were examined as well. h. pylori target dna could not be detected in the stools of any of the infected patients. it was concluded that there was no substantial shedding of h. pylori in feces from either group of patients."
"lansoprazole. a reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and its therapeutic efficacy in acid-related disorders. lansoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative that effectively decreases gastric acid secretion, regardless of the primary stimulus, via inhibition of gastric h+,k(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (atpase). it provides effective symptom relief and healing of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis after to weeks of therapy and appears to prevent recurrence of lesions when administered as maintenance therapy. when administered at therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produced higher healing rates than ranitidine or famotidine in patients with duodenal and gastric ulcers. lansoprazole heals duodenal ulcers more rapidly than ranitidine or famotidine. relief of ulcer symptoms in lansoprazole recipients is at least equivalent to, and tends to be more rapid than, that in patients receiving histamine h-receptor antagonists. in comparisons with omeprazole mg/day, lansoprazole mg/day produced duodenal ulcer healing more rapidly and reduced ulcer pain to a greater extent at weeks, but overall healing rates were similar after weeks of therapy. at therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produces superior healing and symptom relief of reflux oesophagitis in comparison with ranitidine, and it tends to relieve heartburn more effectively than omeprazole, although both agents produce equivalent healing. healing of peptic ulcers or reflux oesophagitis refractory to histamine h-receptor antagonists occurs after weeks in the majority of patients treated with lansoprazole, and lansoprazole and omeprazole demonstrate similar efficacy in patients with refractory peptic ulcers. in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome, lansoprazole effectively controls mean basal gastric acid output. lansoprazole is generally well tolerated in clinical trials. the incidence of adverse effects is similar to that of omeprazole, ranitidine and famotidine in comparative studies. combination therapy with lansoprazole and antibacterial agents such as amoxicillin, tinidazole, roxithromycin and/or metronidazole appears to eradicate helicobacter pylori in to % of patients with this organism. limited data also suggest that lansoprazole may have superior activity against h. pylori in comparison with omeprazole, although the clinical relevance of this preliminary finding requires further confirmation. thus, lansoprazole may be considered as alternative to existing antisecretory agents available for the treatment of acid-related disorders, particularly because it may provide more rapid healing and relief of symptoms."

"pharmacological management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) ranges from episodic symptomatic reflux without oesophagitis to severe oesophageal mucosal damage, such as barrett's metaplasia or peptic stricture. the multifactorial pathogenesis of gord prevents medical cure of the disease. gord is a chronic disease with a high tendency to relapse, requiring a long term treatment strategy in practically all patients. complete healing of all mucosal lesions is not necessarily the aim of treatment in all patients. in milder forms of reflux disease, symptom relief is the most important goal. many patients with mild gord do well on symptomatic self-care with antacids and/or alginate. in addition, lifestyle changes should be advised to all patients: these improve symptoms and enhance the efficacy of therapy. in the acute treatment of gord the prokinetic drug cisapride has been shown to be effective in relieving symptoms and healing grade i to ii oesophagitis. cisapride decreases symptomatic and endoscopic relapse in patients with mild gord. histamine h-receptor antagonists are effective in relieving reflux symptoms in about % of patients, but with regard to healing, h-antagonists appear to be mainly effective in grades i and ii and not in higher grades of oesophagitis. maintenance treatment with h-antagonists is mainly symptomatically effective in patients with mild gord. proton pump inhibitors (ppis) provide significantly higher healing rates of reflux oesophagitis than h-antagonists, even in the more severe cases of oesophagitis and barrett's ulcers. ppis are also effective in patients with oesophagitis refractory to treatment with h-antagonists. ppis have become the drugs of first choice in healing of all patients with more severe forms of reflux oesophagitis, and increasingly also for patients with milder forms of oesophagitis, certainly those who fail to respond to other drugs. in maintenance treatment of gord, ppis are the most effective drugs, offering the possibility of keeping nearly all patients in remission with adjusted doses. current patient data of up to years indicate the safety of this strategy for this period, but the exact consequences of strong acid inhibition over a longer period still have to be clarified. at present, all but a few patients with gord can be managed adequately by medical therapy."
"the rationale for continuous maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis. reflux esophagitis is a chronic process associated with frequent episodes of relapse in many patients. in addition, the disease may be progressive in at least some patients. erosion of the esophageal mucosa precedes the development of some of the complications of the condition. there is accumulating evidence that continuous treatment of patients with erosive esophagitis effectively maintains symptomatic remission and absence of esophageal erosions. whether such treatment will prevent the development of complications has not yet been demonstrated. we investigated a number of questions concerning the natural history and complications of erosive esophagitis and the need for maintenance treatment for patients with severe manifestations of disease as well as the impact of continuous maintenance treatment on the natural history of reflux esophagitis and its complications."
"omeprazole and h-receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis: a meta-analysis. this paper is a meta-analysis of published, double-blind clinical trials comparing omeprazole with ranitidine or cimetidine for the treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. these studies compare the recommended doses of omeprazole with those for ranitidine and cimetidine, and the confidence intervals for the therapeutic gain show that the findings are highly reliable. the difference in healing rates favoured omeprazole over ranitidine in patients with duodenal ulcer after weeks of treatment (. percentage units; p < .), and after weeks of treatment in patients with gastric ulcer (. percentage units; p = .), or reflux oesophagitis ( percentage units; p < .). similarly, omeprazole gave a . percentage units higher average healing rate than cimetidine in patients with duodenal ulcer after weeks of treatment (p < .). significantly more patients treated with omeprazole were free of symptoms at their first follow-up visit than patients treated with ranitidine or cimetidine."
"omeprazole-amoxycillin therapy for eradication of helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer bleeding: preliminary results of a pilot study. thirty-five patients with duodenal ulcer bleeding and helicobacter pylori-colonization were assigned to receive x mg omeprazole and x mg amoxycillin daily for weeks. eradication was defined as no evidence of h. pylori infection by urease test and by histology weeks after completion of therapy. two patients were lost to follow up. all ulcers healed completely (% ulcer healing rate). twenty-nine out of the patients were h. pylori-negative (.% eradication rate). three patients complained of typical side effects of amoxycillin (.% side effect rate). the patients were prospectively followed for months. after ulcer healing, no maintenance therapy was given. one of the patients in whom h. pylori eradication had been successful suffered a second ulcer hemorrhage with h. pylori reinfection (.% relapse rate of ulcer bleeding), and this was managed endoscopically. recurrent ulcer hemorrhage occurred in out of h. pylori-resistant patients. at the end of the follow-up period, of the patients in whom h. pylori eradication had been initially successful, only the patient with re-bleeding remained reinfected. the h. pylori-resistant patients showed persistent h. pylori colonization. in conclusion, omeprazole plus amoxycillin is a safe and effective treatment for eradicating h. pylori; this treatment reduces the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer bleeding."
"laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is a satisfactory alternative to long-term omeprazole therapy. a total of patients with proven gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) receiving long-term medical therapy underwent laparoscopic nissen fundoplication. the operation was converted to open fundoplication in four patients. all patients reported complete (. per cent) or partial (. per cent) relief of reflux symptoms month after surgery. there were no associated deaths and the perioperative complication rate was . per cent. the mean(s.e.m.) length of operating time was .(.) min and mean(s.e.m.) hospital stay .(.) days. symptom score assessment, -h oesophageal ph recording and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure showed significant (p < .) improvement months after surgery in evaluable patients. before operation . per cent of the patients were considered symptomatically controlled on omeprazole and had excellent symptom control after surgery. this initial experience suggests that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is a safe and effective treatment for patients with gord requiring long-term medication."
"treatment of helicobacter pylori infections. the available literature on the relationship between several diseases and helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is reviewed. duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, complicated peptic ulcer, abdominal symptoms and gastroduodenal mucosal damage during the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), non-ulcer dyspepsia (nud) and gastric malignancy are discussed. the case for and against eradication is critically discussed. eradication of h. pylori should be pursued in all patients with peptic ulcer disease, whether they are using nsaids or not. eradication of h. pylori in the treatment of nud should be considered experimental. treatment aimed at the eradication of h. pylori should be considered in all patients with low-grade malignant mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt) lymphoma and in all patients with mntrier's disease. finally, this treatment should be considered in a subset of h. pylori-infected patients who possibly are at an increased risk of gastric cancer: patients with a strong family history of gastric carcinoma and patients in need of long-term treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor. in view of the importance of patient compliance, the risk of side-effects and the possibility of inducing metronidazole resistance when treatment with a metronidazole-containing regimen is used, treatment aimed at the eradication of h. pylori should be carefully implemented and monitored."
"peptic ulcer--a new look. this review covers major advances in peptic ulcer disease over the last years. flexible endoscopy enables accurate diagnosis of peptic ulcer to be made and its introduction made possible the large number of controlled clinical trials on the use of various agents in peptic ulcer treatment. the histamine h- receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid output, were the first major group of potent ulcer healing drugs introduced. subsequently, other ulcer healing agents with different modes of action, e.g. colloidal bismuth, sucralfate, prostaglandin analogues, omeprazole were also shown to be effective. the identification of helicobacter pylori ten years ago was another major advance in peptic ulcer disease. this bacterium is now thought to be the most important cause of peptic ulcer disease and its eradication cures the disease. there are still unanswered questions regarding varying sequelae of helicobacter pylori infection, the effect of the infection on gastric acid and gastrin secretion while a convenient and effective treatment regime remains to be developed. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are now thought to be the second most important cause of peptic ulcer disease and a major risk factor for ulcer complications and mortality. while misoprostol and histamine h- antagonists can prevent peptic ulcer associated with these substances, indications for prophylaxis have not yet been defined. if helicobacter pylori infection could be controlled through improved socio-economic standards and possible development of a vaccine, and if anti-inflammatory drugs devoid of gastric side effects can be developed, peptic ulcer may become a less important health problem in the future."

"effect of triple therapy or amoxycillin plus omeprazole or amoxycillin plus tinidazole plus omeprazole on duodenal ulcer healing, eradication of helicobacter pylori, and prevention of ulcer relapse over a -year follow-up period: a prospective, randomized, controlled study. triple therapy and amoxycillin plus omeprazole are the two most widely recommended regimens for the eradication of helicobacter pylori. however, no controlled studies with a large number of cases are available for the reliable comparison of these two regimens. the aim of this controlled, randomized, prospective study was to compare the effect of these two regimens and a further regimen for metronidazole-resistant patients on duodenal ulcer healing, h. pylori eradication, and prevention of ulcer relapse."
"triple therapy with sucralfate, tetracycline, and metronidazole for helicobacter pylori-associated duodenal ulcers. triple therapy with bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline or amoxicillin is effective for the treatment of helicobacter pylori, but side effects are common. sucralfate inhibits h. pylori hemagglutinin, protease, and lipase and thus might affect colonization of the bacterium in the stomach."
"intragastric acidity as a predictor of the success of helicobacter pylori eradication: a study in peptic ulcer patients with omeprazole and amoxicillin. omeprazole plus amoxicillin cures helicobacter pylori infection. the hypothesis was tested that low acidity is a predictor of outcome. fifty patients with relapsing or complicated, or both h pylori positive duodenal (n = ) or gastric ulcer (n = ) were randomly treated with either omeprazole mg twice daily plus amoxicillin g twice daily or with omeprazole mg twice daily plus amoxicillin g twice daily over two weeks. after one week of combined treatment, a hour gastric ph measurement was performed in all patients. h pylori cure rate was %. patients who later turned out to be cured had higher ph values during night time and after meals (p < .). in an explorative analysis drug compliance, smoking, location of the ulcer (duodenum versus stomach), age, and grade of body gastritis were additional predictors of the outcome. smoking (p = .), compliance (p = .), duodenal ulcer disease (p = .), and young age (p = .) were related to high acidity. in conclusion, the success of eradication treatment with omeprazole and amoxicillin in ulcer patients infected with h pylori depends on intragastric ph. drug compliance, smoking habits, location of ulcer, age, and activity of body gastritis are other predictors and in part related to intragastric acidity."
"the efficacy of two doses of omeprazole for short- and long-term peptic ulcer treatment in the elderly. this study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and most suitable dose of omeprazole in short-term acute treatment ( weeks) and maintenance treatment ( months) of patients older than years of age with endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcer (gu) or duodenal ulcer (du). this randomized, prospective study included patients ( gu and du; mean age, . and . years, respectively) who were randomized in the acute phase into two treatment groups: omeprazole mg/d or mg/d as a single morning dose for weeks. the -month follow-up phase included patients who were randomized to receive omeprazole mg/d or mg every other day. after weeks of treatment, .% of gu patients and .% of du patients showed complete ulcer scarring with no statistical differences between doses. at the end of the -month follow-up, .% of gu patients and .% of du patients relapsed, with no statistical differences between groups. no clinically significant adverse events were recorded. in conclusion, omeprazole is a highly effective, well-tolerated, and safe drug for the short- and long-term treatment of gu and du in the elderly. the dose of mg/d for the acute phase and mg on alternate days for maintenance therapy appears most appropriate for elderly patients with ulcers."
"prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal ulcers: role of mucosal protective and gastric antisecretory drugs. one of the most serious side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) is upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage that may result in erosions, ulcerations and other serious complications. nsaids reduce endogenous prostaglandins, and this reduction is relevant to their pharmacology and toxicity. the stomach and to some extent the duodenum are the major organs involved in the mucosal toxicity of nsaids. with the availability of the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol, it has become possible to prevent nsaid-induced gastroduodenal ulcers without compromising the beneficial antirheumatic and analgesic effects of nsaid therapy. in fact, misoprostol is the only drug with established long-term efficacy in preventing nsaid-induced gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatic patients. the purpose of this communication is to critically review the efficacy of gastric antisecretory drugs, mucosal protective drugs and misoprostol when used for the prevention of nsaid-induced ulcers, considering only data from well-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical studies. the histamine h-receptor antagonist ranitidine has been shown to be effective in preventing nsaid-induced duodenal ulcers, but has no efficacy in preventing nsaid-induced gastric ulcers. in a direct comparative trial with ranitidine, misoprostol ( micrograms qid) was significantly more effective than ranitidine ( mg bid) in preventing gastric ulcers in chronic nsaid users. the inactivity of ranitidine in preventing gastric ulcers indicates that the pathogenesis of nsaid-induced gastric ulcers is not related to gastric acid. limited but conflicting data exist with omeprazole. the mucosal-coating drug sucralfate has not been found effective in preventing nsaid ulcers. in fact, in a direct comparative trial, misoprostol ( micrograms qid) was significantly more effective than sucralfate ( g qid) in preventing gastric ulcers in patients receiving chronic nsaid therapy. no meaningful data exist with organic bismuth salts, a group of drugs which has mucosal coating and protective properties. from this brief overview, we conclude: () mucosal-coating compounds have no therapeutic role in preventing nsaid-induced ulceration; () gastric antisecretory drugs are not effective in preventing nsaid-induced gastric ulcers, and () misoprostol is the only antiulcer drug proven to be effective for preventing nsaid-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients receiving chronic nsaid. misoprostol represents a major therapeutic advance for the management of nsaid-induced mucosal injury."

"influence of lansoprazole on intragastric -hour ph, meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion, and concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones and enzymes in serum and gastric juice in healthy volunteers. twelve healthy volunteers ( females, males) between and years of age were enroled in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study. the objective was to determine the influence of lansoprazole (agopton, takeda pharma gmbh, aachen), a novel proton pump inhibitor, in doses of and mg, on the intragastric ph, on meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and on the concentration of gastrointestinal hormones and enzymes in serum and gastric juice. active drug or placebo had to be taken as single daily morning doses on an empty stomach for days. each wash-out period between drug application periods was weeks long. lansoprazole induced a dose-related increase in intragastric ph as well as a relevant reduction of basal acid output, meal-stimulated acid output and meal-stimulated secretion volume. mg lansoprazole was significantly superior to mg in increasing intragastric ph. the basal secretion volume in volunteers on and mg lansoprazole were lower than in volunteers on placebo. serum gastrin and serum pepsinogen concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. pepsin output and pepsin activity in gastric juice were slightly decreased in volunteers on mg lansoprazole and markedly suppressed in volunteers on mg lansoprazole h after meal stimulation. intrinsic factor concentration increased in volunteers on lansoprazole with a clear dose relationship. the evaluation of laboratory data and reported nonserious adverse events proved the relative safety of this new antiulcer agent."
"severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. medical and surgical options for long-term care. severe gastroesophageal reflux disease is usually a chronic problem with periods of relapse, but effective medical and surgical therapies are available. two recently introduced agents, omeprazole (prilosec) and cisapride (propulsid), represent advances in medical therapy; the safety of long-term, continuous omeprazole therapy is under investigation. used by surgeons with sufficient experience, the new laparoscopic approach offers potential advantages over conventional anti-reflux surgery in suitable candidates. the decision of whether to recommend long-term medical therapy or surgery must be individualized. medical therapy may be the best choice in elderly patients and poor surgical candidates, in patients whose symptoms are well controlled with omeprazole and who accept its benefit-risk profile, and when a highly experienced anti-reflux surgeon is not available. surgery may be appropriate (assuming a skilled surgeon is available) in patients who are young, have trouble taking medication, need multiple agents to control symptoms, and need continuous omeprazole therapy but are unwilling to accept the theoretical risk of gastric carcinoid tumors that accompanies it."

"helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. since william beaumont's classic description of gastric physiology in , the focus of clinical practice and basic research concerning gastric and duodenal ulcers has centered on the secretion of acid and pepsin. in addition to these well-known factors (largely determined by heredity, age, and oral intake), the search for other agents that alter the mucosal barrier has identified a bacillus, helicobacter pylori, as a significant agent in the development of chronic gastritis and benign gastric and duodenal ulcers. this review explores the scientific evidence for an important causal role of h. pylori in the development of peptic ulcers on the basis of pathologic, pathophysiologic, and pharmacologic data."
"nsaid-induced peptic ulcer disease: a critical review of pathogenesis and management. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) initiate gastroduodenal ulceration and promote complications such as bleeding and perforation. age greater than years, a prior history of ulcer disease, and concomitant corticosteroid use are important risk factors for ulcer development. nsaids interfere with mucosal defense via direct toxic effects in addition to cyclooxygenase inhibition and subsequent depletion of endogenous prostaglandins. while all nsaids are ulcerogenic, drugs which avoid topical injury and do not inhibit mucosal prostaglandins appear to have lesser risk of toxicity. although nsaid injury requires luminal acid, prophylactic use of h receptor antagonists has been disappointing, preventing duodenal injury only. greater acid suppression with proton pump inhibition appears promising. prostaglandins are effective for prevention of nsaid-induced gastroduodenal injury, but are not well tolerated. recent evidence suggests nsaid ulcers heal rapidly with proton pump inhibitors compared to h receptor antagonists in those patients who require continued nsaid therapy."
"pharmacokinetic optimisation of the treatment of peptic ulcer in patients with renal failure. the pathogenesis of peptic ulceration is not yet clear. it could be due to an imbalance between acid secretion and mucosal defensive and/or protective mechanisms, but the association between helicobacter pylori and peptic ulceration has questioned this hypothesis. therefore, drugs inhibiting acid secretion and/or eradicating h. pylori are of major interest. peptic ulcer disease is often associated with renal failure. for the selection of the proper dosage of these agents their pharmacokinetic properties and alterations in pharmacokinetics in various disease states, including renal failure, should be known. as histamine h-receptor antagonists and pirenzepine are mainly eliminated by the renal route their elimination is dependent on creatinine clearance. consequently, their elimination will be impaired in patients with renal insufficiency, which makes dosage reduction mandatory in these patients. no dosage supplementation is necessary after any type of dialysis because the drugs are removed in insignificant amounts by the various blood purification procedures. misoprostol and proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole, are primarily eliminated by nonrenal routes. therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. bismuth salts, sucralfate and antacids should be avoided in patients with renal failure because of the accumulation of their cations and the associated risk of toxic reactions. for most agents more long term experience from comparative and double-blinded studies is needed to define better their clinical efficacy and tolerability in patients with renal failure."

"treatment of gastroesophageal (acid) reflux with lansoprazole: an overview. despite the fact that reflux esophagitis is a multifactorial disease, inhibition of gastric acid secretion is the mainstay of medical treatment, both for moderate and severe cases. antisecretory agents lower the acidity of the refluxate, thus decreasing its aggressive effect, which favors the mucosal healing process. the greater the acid inhibition, the greater will be the mucosal repair. this is the reason for a therapeutic gain for h-receptor antagonists over anticholinergics and antacids, and for proton pump inhibitors over h-receptor antagonists. the most recently developed proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, at doses of , , or mg/day for and weeks of treatment, has proven to be significantly more effective than placebo (one multicenter study involving patients) or ranitidine (three multicenter studies involving patients) in terms of mucosal healing and symptom relief. in two comparative trials with omeprazole mg vs lansoprazole mg (in a total of evaluable patients) healing rates were found to be similar, but in one trial the relief of heartburn proved to be significantly more pronounced in patients receiving lansoprazole who also used fewer antacids. the frequency of adverse events was comparable in the two treatment groups. reflux esophagitis is a chronic condition and after stopping antisecretory treatment, including lansoprazole, most patients relapse in terms of symptoms and endoscopical lesions, which suggests the need for long-term treatment. however, a strategy for long-term control of reflux esophagitis remains to be defined (lower daily dose, alternate-day standard dose, or concomitant prokinetic drugs?). the safety of proton pump inhibitors given for prolonged periods also needs to be more thoroughly evaluated."

"review article: helicobacter pylori eradication--understandable caution but no excuse for inertia. the long-term management of patients with peptic ulcer disease is unsatisfactory, as judged by the persistently high levels of haemorrhage, perforation and death from this condition in western countries. although ulcer recurrence and complications can be prevented, many patients with peptic ulcer disease fail to receive the benefits of modern therapeutic regimens. in recent years, eradication of helicobactor pylori has been promoted as a 'cure' for peptic ulcer disease and, while such claims are premature, there can be little doubt that this treatment--when successful--dramatically improves the medium-term prognosis of ulcer patients. however, in general, clinicians have given this promising therapeutic advance a lukewarm welcome. the aim of this detailed review of the literature is to remove the uncertainty and confusion surrounding many aspects of eradication therapy. estimates are provided of the eradication rates after either triple therapy or the combination of omeprazole plus amoxycillin, and the sources of variation in published studies are discussed. problems associated with eradication therapy, including side effects, compliance and re-infection, are addressed in order to ascertain the extent and clinical significance of each factor. in addition, studies reporting the outcome of patients with peptic ulcer disease after eradication are assessed with reference to both ulcer recurrence and complications. the result of the review is to dissipate much of the scepticism concerning eradication therapy. however, whilst acknowledging the efficacy of eradication therapy, its limitations have also to be recognized. by itself, it does not provide the complete answer to peptic ulcer disease. for some ulcer patients, eradication therapy is the preferred option; for others, prophylactic therapy with h-receptor antagonists is more suitable. guidelines are proposed for the selection of patients for each alternative therapy. the crucial point is that patients with peptic ulcer--excluding the small proportion with a mild form of the disease--require positive, long-term management consisting of either continuous prophylaxis with h-receptor antagonists or the eradication of helicobacter pylori."

"bismuth-free triple therapy for eradicating helicobacter pylori and reducing the gastric ulcer recurrence rate. the goals of this study were to assess the effectiveness of a new triple therapy consisting of amoxicillin and metronidazole with plaunotol in the eradication of helicobacter pylori infection in humans, and to determine whether this treatment regimen reduces the rate of recurrence of gastric ulcer in patients infected with h. pylori, without instituting maintenance therapy with h-receptor antagonists."
"effect of omeprazole and sucralfate on prepyloric gastric ulcer. a double blind comparative trial and one year follow up. this study compared healing rates, relief of symptoms, frequency of adverse events, and proportion of patients in remission after one year follow up in patients with active prepyloric ulcer during treatment with mg omeprazole once daily or g sucralfate twice daily, using a randomised double blind controlled trial. healing rates after two, four, and six weeks were (omeprazole/sucralfate) %/%; %/%; %/% respectively. after two weeks, omeprazole was more efficient than sucralfate in relief of daytime and nocturnal epigastric pain, nausea, and heartburn. the proportion of patients in remission after one year follow up was significantly higher in the omeprazole group (p < .). of the healed patients ulcers recurred in % in the omeprazole group and in % in the sucralfate group. it is concluded that the ulcer healing rate was higher and symptom relief was more pronounced in the omeprazole group compared with the sucralfate group, and that more patients were still in remission after a one year follow up period."
short report: omeprazole-tetracycline combinations are inadequate as therapy for helicobacter pylori infection. current triple antimicrobial therapies cure helicobacter pylori infection in -% of cases but are cumbersome. addition of omeprazole to amoxycillin has been shown to enhance effectiveness when compared to amoxycillin alone.
"effects of eradication of helicobacter pylori on gastritis in duodenal ulcer patients. the incidence and mean score of helicobacter pylori-related, active antroduodenitis, lesions of superficial antral epithelium and duodenal gastric-type metaplasia were higher in endoscopic biopsies from a large series of patients with duodenal ulcer, when compared with asymptomatic patients or patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. in out of patients with duodenal ulcer who could be followed up, h. pylori was eradicated using a combination of amoxycillin, g daily, metronidazole, g daily, and omeprazole, mg daily. rapid and permanent (-month follow-up) abolition of both gastroduodenitis activity and lesions of the gastric surface epithelium was observed in these patients. there was also a progressive decrease in total immune-inflammatory cells but without a substantial change in duodenal gastric-type metaplasia. similar, but transient and quantitatively less prominent, improvements were observed in the antroduodenal mucosa, which had been temporarily cleared of h. pylori by treatment with omeprazole alone. conversely, increased gastritis activity, epithelial lesions and immune-inflammatory cell scores were found in the short term in the corpus mucosa, which was not cleared of h. pylori after omeprazole treatment. it is concluded that, of the various h. pylori-related mucosal changes, antroduodenitis activity and antral epithelial lesions most closely reflect the severity of mucosal damage and are probably the most important factors in duodenal ulcerogenesis. their complete and rapid suppression after bacterial eradication may be a key factor in preventing ulcer relapse."
"prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse by long-term treatment with omeprazole. duodenal ulcer is a chronic disease with a high risk of relapse--if left untreated, the relapse rate is -% per year (). however, the relapse rate can be effectively reduced by inhibition of gastric acid secretion. although many patients can be managed with episodic therapy, controlled either by the patient or doctor, continuous maintenance treatment is often necessary for patients with severe forms of the disease and those at risk of complications (). maintenance therapy with single night-time doses of an h-receptor antagonist reduces relapse rates from approximately % to % per year (). as omeprazole is more effective than the h-receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer, healing virtually all patients within weeks (), it may also be more effective in the maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcer disease. to date, three studies have reported the effect of omeprazole on relapse rates of duodenal ulcer. a danish multicentre study involved patients, who were treated with omeprazole, either mg once daily, or mg once daily on friday, saturday and sunday (weekend therapy), or with placebo (). after months, the remission rates were % and %, respectively, for those patients receiving omeprazole--significantly higher than in those receiving placebo (% after months). an italian multicentre study of patients found that omeprazole, both mg once daily, and mg once daily at weekends (friday, saturday and sunday), was equally effective in preventing relapse. the proportions of patients in remission were % and %, respectively, after months ().(abstract truncated at words)."
"efficacy of omeprazole in lower grades of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. grade i oesophagitis is usually considered to be a less severe form of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord). however, with regard to symptom severity, patients without macroscopic mucosal lesions have been shown not to differ from those with more severe oesophagitis. a number of controlled trials on the efficacy of omeprazole in gord have included patients with lower grades of the disease. the results show that the differences in efficacy between omeprazole and h-receptor antagonists, which have been established for the treatment of erosive and ulcerative oesophagitis, also extend to patients with grade i oesophagitis (erythema and friability). in these studies, omeprazole provided more rapid symptom resolution and histological improvement than ranitidine. in one double-blind comparative trial, complete endoscopic normalization of the oesophageal mucosa was observed in % of patients with grade i oesophagitis within weeks of treatment with omeprazole, mg once daily, compared with % of those treated with ranitidine, mg twice daily; at weeks the mucosa in all patients in the omeprazole group had completely healed at endoscopy, while oesophagitis was still present in % of the patients receiving ranitidine. a separate -month, placebo-controlled maintenance study was performed in patients who had completed a short-term study and who had total relief from the major symptoms of gord and complete healing of endoscopic oesophagitis. all patients given placebo had an endoscopic recurrence (i.e. endoscopic grade i or more) and this was associated with the return of symptoms in % of cases.(abstract truncated at words)."
"long-term treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease with omeprazole. reflux oesophagitis is a chronic disorder with frequent relapses on cessation of initial successful treatment. in patients with reflux oesophagitis, treatment with the acid pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has repeatedly been demonstrated to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and of erosive and/or ulcerative lesions in the oesophagus. comparative trials have shown that an average of % of oesophagitis patients were maintained in endoscopic and symptomatic remission over a period of months when treated with omeprazole, mg once daily. this compares with only % of patients in remission when given 'full-dose' h-receptor antagonist therapy (ranitidine, mg daily). it is interesting to note that, in a recent trial, % of reflux oesophagitis patients were in remission after months of treatment with omeprazole, mg once daily, compared with the corresponding figure of % among those on mg once daily. in patients poorly responsive to control of oesophagitis with h-receptor antagonists, omeprazole at a dose of at least mg daily is required to achieve symptom resolution and endoscopic healing--and remission can be maintained for years with continued omeprazole treatment. omeprazole has been shown to have a good long-term safety profile, as evaluated in these trials."
"appropriate acid suppression for optimal healing of duodenal ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. comparisons of the effectiveness of treatments for healing duodenal ulcer are essential to determine optimal management strategies for both economic analysis and quality-of-life evaluation. differences are usually made on the basis of the proportion of ulcers healed at varying time intervals. it has been shown by meta-analysis that healing of duodenal ulcers with antisecretory drugs is directly correlated to the degree of acid suppression. more recently, sophisticated meta-analysis of -hour intragastric acidity data and clinical trials of antisecretory drugs has demonstrated that the optimal degree and duration of gastric acid suppression for healing duodenal ulcer can be achieved by an aggregate time above ph of - hours/day. these conditions predict % ulcer healing at weeks. antisecretory drug regimens that approach these criteria should achieve faster healing than other agents, with a concomitant acceleration of symptom resolution. regression analysis was performed on the healing-time curves for each drug class to determine the rate of ulcer healing per week. the mean proportion of ulcers healed, irrespective of treatment duration, was highest for omeprazole, which also provided a significantly faster rate of duodenal ulcer healing than all other drug classes (p < .). it has recently been shown that healing of erosive oesophagitis with antisecretory drugs is directly correlated with both the duration of acid suppression over the -hour period (p < .) and the elevation of intra-oesophageal ph above . furthermore, oesophageal acid exposure time can be normalized by maintaining the intra-oesophageal ph above for at least % of the -hour period.(abstract truncated at words)."
"clinical review of lansoprazole. lansoprazole is an inhibitor of gastric h+,k(+)-atpase, commonly referred to as the 'proton pump'. the pharmacodynamic effect of proton pump inhibition is to reduce gastric acid secretion. long experience with h antagonists and more recently proton pump inhibitors has demonstrated the value of reducing gastric acid secretion in conditions where acid plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration. the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical safety of lansoprazole are discussed elsewhere in this supplement, and so this review will focus upon the european and american experience of the efficacy of lansoprazole in the treatment of peptic ulceration and gastro-oesophageal reflux."

"a pharmacodynamic study of two omeprazole regimens suitable for long-term treatment of duodenal ulcer. the experience with long-term treatment of peptic ulcer with omeprazole is still scant, but the possibility cannot be excluded that its better pharmacodynamic effect on gastric acidity also has a positive result in the relapse rate. moreover, this drug acts via a mechanism other than receptorial binding, and therefore its efficacy should not dissipate with time. this study was carried out to assess the pharmacodynamic properties and the possible changes with time of two dose regimens of omeprazole that could be suitable for long-term treatment in duodenal ulcer."
"use of omeprazole in zollinger-ellison syndrome: a prospective nine-year study of efficacy and safety. h+, k(+)-atpase inhibitors such as omeprazole are the antisecretory agents of choice for the management of gastric acid hypersecretory states, including the zollinger-ellison syndrome. however, long-term follow-up data on the overall efficacy and safety of these agents in large numbers of patients are lacking. in the current study we examined the long-term efficacy and safety of omeprazole in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome treated with oral omeprazole at a single centre for up to months (mean +/- s.e.m. = +/- months). the initial omeprazole maintenance dose was established according to the acute upward dose titration method in / patients (%). gastric acid output was effectively controlled using mg of omeprazole once daily in / patients (%) and / patients (%) required twice daily omeprazole therapy. the mean ranitidine equivalent dose for patients who required mg omeprazole once daily (. +/- . g/day) was significantly lower than the mean ranitidine equivalent dose for patients who required more than mg omeprazole once daily (. +/- . g/day). long-term omeprazole maintenance therapy was discontinued in / patients (%) but in no cases was discontinuation due either to drug-induced side-effects or uncontrolled gastric acid output. fasting serum gastrin levels were significantly elevated above pre-treatment levels at only one time point during follow-up and were likely due to tumour growth rather than a drug effect. the final long-term omeprazole maintenance doses were lower than the initial doses but correlated closely with the pre-omeprazole basal acid output (r = ., p < .) and ranitidine equivalent dose requirements (r = ., p < .). we conclude that omeprazole effectively and safely controls gastric acid hypersecretion in all patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome for up to nine years without evidence by tachyphylaxis."

"effect of omeprazole on intragastric bacterial counts, nitrates, nitrites, and n-nitroso compounds. previous studies have suggested that profound inhibition of gastric acid secretion may increase exposure to potentially carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds. the aim of this study was to find out if the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole ( mg daily) is associated with increased concentrations of potentially carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds in gastric juice. the volume of gastric contents, number of bacteria, and concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, and n-nitroso compounds was determined in gastric aspirates obtained after an overnight fast in healthy volunteers (m:f) after one week of treatment with placebo, and one and two weeks' treatment with omeprazole. median bacterial concentrations were . x () (range . x ()-. x ()) colony forming units (cfu)/ml after one weeks' treatment with placebo and increased significantly to . x () (-. x ()) cfu/ml after two weeks' treatment with omeprazole (p < .). a similar increase was seen in the concentration of nitrate reducing bacteria. there was no difference in the volume of gastric aspirates after treatment with omeprazole when compared with placebo ( (-) ml v (-) ml). the concentration of n-nitroso compounds was . (-.) mumol/l after two weeks of omeprazole, which was not significantly different from that seen with placebo (. (-.) mumol/l). there was also no increase in the concentrations of nitrates or nitrites. it is concluded that omeprazole ( mg once daily) for two weeks in healthy volunteers is associated with gastric bacterial proliferation but does not increase concentrations of n-nitroso compounds."
"a review of treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers--pantoprazole vs. omeprazole. the efficacy and safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers has been compared with that of the first proton pump inhibitor omeprazole in two (previously reported) clinical studies. pantoprazole ( mg/day) administered orally was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for both indications. pantoprazole was as effective as omeprazole ( mg/day) and had a similar safety profile. for gastric ulcers, the healing rate with pantoprazole was superior to that with omeprazole at weeks."
"long-term therapy with pantoprazole in patients with peptic ulceration resistant to extended high-dose ranitidine treatment. patients () with peptic ulceration of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum, unresponsive to or more months of high-dose treatment with ranitidine, were initially given pantoprazole (- mg, p.o.) daily. in .% of the patients ulcers healed within to weeks, and in .% of patients the ulcers healed within weeks. in just one patient with severe oesophagitis, the lesion took more than months to heal. after ulcer healing, patients ( to date) were treated with pantoprazole ( mg/day) as long-term maintenance therapy. eighty-eight of the patients have been taking pantoprazole for months to years. during maintenance therapy, peptic disease was kept in remission in most patients with mg pantoprazole. twelve patients with oesophagitis and two patients with gastric ulcers needed higher doses (- mg) to control the disease. one female patient developed peripheral oedema which disappeared quickly after stopping treatment. no further drug-related adverse effects were observed. seven patients withdrew from the study and two patients died, all for non-drug-related reasons. routine laboratory tests remained without significant changes in all patients. mean (+/- s.e.m.) serum gastrin levels were already elevated during the initial high-dose ranitidine treatment ( +/- pg/ml). within one year of the start of the pantoprazole treatment, serum gastrin levels rose to times normal values ( +/- pg/ml). thereafter, no further increases in serum gastrin were observed for up to . years. enterochromaffin-like (ecl) cell density increased very slightly from .% to .% within one year.(abstract truncated at words)."
"omeprazole treatment of chronic duodenal ulceration. omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an acid pump inhibitor, introduced for treatment of chronic duodenal ulceration. in a study of patients with endoscopically documented chronic duodenal ulcers, omeprazole affected healing in (.%) patients after two weeks and (.%) patients after four weeks, with symptoms relief in (%) patients within the first week of treatment. there was significantly higher healing rate in females (p < .) and diffuse ulceration rather than single ulcers (p < .). in meta-analysis comparing omeprazole to other antiulcer drugs reported in this country, there was a significant higher healing rate (p < .) and symptom relief (p < .) in favour of omeprazole. it proved to be effective and safe for the short term treatment of chronic duodenal ulceration."
"cytoprotection with misoprostol: use in the treatment and prevention of ulcers. prostaglandins protect the gastric mucosa by decreasing gastric acid secretion, increasing mucus and bicarbonate production and maintaining mucosal blood flow. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) cause gastroduodenal damage and this is due, at least in part, to inhibition of mucosal prostaglandin production. misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin e which has been used in the healing of ulcers and prevention of peptic ulcers in patients taking nsaids. misoprostol is of equal efficacy to h antagonists in the healing of ordinary peptic ulcers (not associated with nsaids). misoprostol is superior to placebo in healing nsaid ulcers during continued nsaid treatment but there have been no comparative trials with other ulcer-healing drugs. misoprostol, h antagonists and sucralfate are of similar efficacy in prevention of nsaid-associated duodenal ulcers but misoprostol is more effective in prevention of gastric ulcers. misoprostol has not been compared to omeprazole in this situation."
"treatment of patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome. in the treatment of zollinger-ellison syndrome patients with severe disease and acid hypersecretion, proton pump inhibitors are the drugs of choice. data have now been accumulated on lansoprazole treatment of patients ( treated at the national institutes of health [nih], bethesda, maryland, usa, and treated at the bichat-claude bernard hospital, paris, france). short-term studies of the inhibitory action of lansoprazole on acid secretion have been carried out in both institutions. our group first performed a dose-response analysis of the efficacy of lansoprazole in reducing basal acid output (bao) in four patients with severe zollinger-ellison syndrome (mean bao +/- [sd] mmol h+/h) who had previously been treated with a mean omeprazole dosage of mg/day. the maximum acid inhibitory effect was obtained with lansoprazole - mg/day. the -hour duration of action of lansoprazole appears equivalent to that of omeprazole. in a second study at the bichat-claude bernard hospital, nine zollinger-ellison syndrome patients underwent -hour intragastric ph monitoring while receiving lansoprazole (mean dosage mg/day, range - mg/day) or omeprazole (mean dosage mg/day, range - mg/day). the acid inhibitory activity of the two drugs was comparable. those patients are currently receiving long-term maintenance treatment with lansoprazole, and satisfactory clinical and biological secretory control has been achieved. the long-term safety and efficacy of lansoprazole administration were studied in the patients followed at the nih. in those patients the initial maintenance dose was determined using acid inhibition studies; in all patients lansoprazole controlled gastric acid hypersecretion and peptic symptoms in both the short and long term. the mean initial maintenance dose was mg qid, except for two patients who required mg bid. during long-term treatment (mean duration months, range - months), six patients required a dosage increase within the first year, while the lansoprazole dose could be reduced in six others. the safety profile of lansoprazole has been excellent. comparable results have been noted in nine zollinger-ellison syndrome patients during an ongoing evaluation in our institution. these studies indicate that lansoprazole is an efficacious, well-tolerated antisecretory agent in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome."
"lansoprazole and helicobacter pylori infection. helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis is present in virtually all patients with duodenal ulcer (du). eradication of h pylori is associated with a highly significant decline in the recurrence rates of du, indicating that treatments aimed at eradicating h pylori are mandatory in these patients. the novel proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole exhibits a potent antiulcer effect and, in vitro, a direct antibacterial effect against h pylori. conflicting data have been reported on the question of whether lansoprazole is bactericidal against h pylori in vivo when administered alone. the aim of this double-blind trial was to address this issue further by comparing the effects of two different -week regimens (lansoprazole alone or in combination with amoxicillin) on h pylori infection in patients with du. patients were assessed before and after the -week treatment and months after stopping the study medication. the ulcer healing rates at weeks were similar for the two treatments while there was a trend for higher recurrence rates at months in patients receiving lansoprazole alone. the frequency of high-grade h pylori infection was significantly lower in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group both at weeks (% clearing) and months. after weeks of treatment there were no patients with residual h pylori-positive active antral gastritis in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group compared with % in the lansoprazole alone group. neither treatment significantly affected the igg antibody response to h pylori either at the circulatory or the mucosal level. in contrast, the mucosal h pylori-specific iga response was significantly enhanced after weeks and more markedly after treatment with lansoprazole.(abstract truncated at words)."

"evidence for the essential role of helicobacter pylori in gastric ulcer disease. helicobacter pylori (h pylori) eradication heals chronic active type b gastritis and dramatically changes the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease. there are few data concerning the role of anti-h pylori treatment in gastric ulcer disease. a total of patients presenting with h pylori positive active gastric ulcer disease were treated with omeprazole and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, roxithromycin) in seven different clinical protocols, each of which included the attempt to eradicate h pylori infection and to evaluate the post-therapeutic course of ulcer disease. the overall proportion of h pylori eradication was .% ( of patients available for follow up). best results were obtained with two week treatment regimens comprising omeprazole mg twice daily and amoxicillin mg four times a day or mg twice daily (eradication > %). eradication of h pylori speeds up ulcer healing, with a six week healing rate of .% compared with % in patients with persistent h pylori infection (p = .). in a subgroup of patients with refractory ulcers, h pylori eradication (n = ) was associated with ulcer healing on continued acid suppression in nine cases. one male patient with chronic antral ulcer did not respond to treatment within the next six months (h pylori and ulcer persistence), and in one female patient a resistant body ulcer was identified as gastric lymphoma. fifty patients with healed ulcers were followed up for one year. patients with (n = ) and without (n = ) bacterial eradication had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. h pylori eradication was associated with a statistically significant reduction of ulcer recurrences (. v .%, p<.). this study concludes that h pylori eradication considerably changes the natural history of h pylori associated gastric ulcer disease. in addition, h pylori eradication speeds up ulcers healing and is associated with healing of previously refractory ulcers. thus, treatment aimed at bacterial eradication should be considered in all patients with gastric ulcers severe enough to contemplate further treatment options."
"duodenal bacterial overgrowth during treatment in outpatients with omeprazole. the extent of duodenal bacterial overgrowth during the pronounced inhibition of acid secretion that occurs with omeprazole treatment is unknown. the bacterial content of duodenal juice of patients treated with omeprazole was therefore examined in a controlled prospective study. duodenal juice was obtained under sterile conditions during diagnostic upper endoscopy. aspirates were plated quantitatively for anaerobic and aerobic organisms. twenty five outpatients with peptic ulcer disease were investigated after a . (.) weeks (mean (sem)) treatment course with mg (nine patients) or mg ( patients). the control group consisted of outpatients referred for diagnostic endoscopy without prior antisecretory treatment. no patient in the control group had duodenal bacterial overgrowth. in the omeprazole group bacterial overgrowth (> or = () cfu/ml) was found in (%) patients (p = .). the number of bacteria (log) in duodenal juice in patients treated with omeprazole was distinctly higher (median .; range < -.) when compared with the control group (median < ; range < -.; p = .). as well as orally derived bacteria, faecal type bacteria were found in seven of and anaerobic bacteria in three of patients. bacterial overgrowth was similar with the two doses of omeprazole. these results indicate that duodenal bacterial overgrowth of both oral and faecal type bacteria occurs often in ambulatory patients treated with omeprazole. further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings, particularly in high risk groups during long term treatment with omeprazole."
"eradication of helicobacter pylori and prevention of recurrence of duodenal ulcer: a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre trial of omeprazole with or without clarithromycin. antimicrobial treatment for helicobacter pylori eradication is currently recommended for all patients with duodenal ulcer disease, but consensus on the best treatment is lacking."

"laparoscopic fundoplication in the treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease: preliminary results of a prospective trial. to determine the technical feasibility and success of laparoscopic fundoplication in the treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), consecutive adult patients were enrolled in a prospective study. all patients had received unsuccessful conservative treatment, were refractory to medical management, or had recurrence of symptoms of esophagitis after omeprazole therapy. all patients had severe acid reflux on -hour esophageal ph monitoring, endoscopic evidence of previous or ongoing esophagitis, and a defective lower esophageal sphincter on manometry. complete (nissen) fundoplication was done in and partial (toupet) fundoplication in patients; the mean operative time was minutes (range, to minutes). feedings were initiated on the first postoperative day, and the average length of stay was . days (range, to ). there were no deaths or conversions to laparotomy. postoperative morbidity consisted of transient bloating in three patients and dysphagia requiring dilatation in four patients. return to work or normal activity averaged days (range, to ), and patients (%) reported good to excellent results, with a median follow-up of months. laparoscopic fundoplication is technically feasible and offers a sound surgical alternative to patients with refractory gerd, but longitudinal follow-up is required to confirm long-term results."
"cure of helicobacter pylori infection: role of duration of treatment with omeprazole and amoxicillin. to date, some studies have suggested that short-term therapy may be a promising therapeutic concept for the eradication of helicobacter pylori. the primary objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of the duration of treatment in the cure of h. pylori infection."

lansoprazole capsules and amoxicillin oral suspension in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. lansoprazole is a potent antisecretory drug also possessing anti-helicobacter pylori activity in vitro. it is a candidate drug for combination regimens with antibiotics for treating h. pylori infections.
non-bleeding visible vessel treatment: perendoscopic injection therapy versus omeprazole infusion. the non-bleeding visible vessel in a peptic ulcer is the highest risk factor for a bleeding recurrence among not actively bleeding lesions. perendoscopic injection of sclerosing compounds is usually used as prophylaxis against rebleeding.
"helicobacter pylori eradication: a critical appraisal and current concerns. helicobacter pylori is now well recognized as a critical factor in the majority of patients with peptic ulcer disease and successful treatment of the infection results in cure of the disease. however, treatment of this infection has proved difficult, involving a combination of drugs, and has usually involved complex treatment regimens. triple therapy involving a bismuth compound in combination with metronidazole and tetracycline or amoxicillin have been most widely used and achieve successful cure of the infection in about % of cases when the tetracycline combination is used. more recently, the use of the proton-pump inhibitors in combination with amoxicillin have been widely advocated to combine effective symptom relief with high ulcer healing rates and an opportunity to cure the disease. however, all these treatments have some disadvantages due to unpredictability, adverse events, complex regimens making compliance difficult, or cost. this article reviews the results of current treatments for the eradication of h. pylori infection and identifies opportunities for the development of optimal approaches to the cure of this infection."
sucralfate in helicobacter pylori eradication strategies. sucralfate monotherapy has been shown to suppress but not eradicate helicobacter pylori. the combination of sucralfate with antibiotic(s) has been evaluated recently in the treatment of h. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. the aim of this article is to review the efficacy of sucralfate-containing duotherapy and triple therapy in duodenal ulcer healing and h. pylori eradication rates.
"helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer. helicobacter pylori is an important pathogen causing both gastric and duodenal ulcer. the causal relationship is based on the strong association of peptic ulcer with h. pylori-induced gastritis, the improved rate of healing with h. pylori suppression, and markedly low recurrence rates for ulcer after h. pylori eradication. the ideal regimen for h. pylori eradication should be simple, inexpensive, free of side effects, and effective in at least % of patients. triple therapy involving bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline or amoxicillin results in the best and most consistent eradication data, but there is a significant incidence of side effects and problems with compliance. acid suppression with ranitidine or omeprazole combined with antibiotics is effective but expensive with variable results in clinical trials. sucralfate may also reduce h. pylori density and enhance the action of antibiotics used in eradication regimens. studies reported in this journal suggest that sucralfate can be successfully substituted for bismuth in triple therapy regimens with documented efficacy and few side effects. considerable progress in developing newer regimens to eradicate h. pylori has been made. however, the development of an ideal drug or regimen remains a challenge."
"helicobacter pylori eradication: unravelling the facts. recommendations for the choice, doses or duration of eradication therapy are still lacking. the purpose of this review was therefore to assess what conclusions could be drawn about eradication therapy, subsequent reinfection with helicobacter pylori and ulcer recurrence."
"helicobacter pylori eradication in a clinical setting: success rates and the effect on the quality of life in peptic ulcer. helicobacter pylori eradication for peptic ulcer has been widely taken up. evidence for the efficacy of different regimens is often derived from small series in clinical trials but there is little reporting of everyday practice with unselected patients. freedom from ulcer relapse has been demonstrated, but not whether this equates with clinical success."

"effect of parenteral omeprazole and ranitidine on gastric ph and the outcome of bleeding peptic ulcer. the pharmacotherapy of bleeding peptic ulcer is directed at attempting to keep the gastric ph above the proteolytic range for pepsin. in this randomized, prospective, open clinical trial we have compared the effects and outcome of omeprazole versus ranitidine in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. of consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, (.%) had an ulcer with endoscopic predictors of rebleeding at the time of diagnosis. these patients were selected at random to receive either omeprazole ( mg bolus and mg/ h i.v.) or ranitidine ( mg/ h i.v.). no endoscopic therapy was performed at the time of diagnosis. twenty of these patients with duodenal ulcer (n = omeprazole, n = ranitidine) underwent -h gastric ph monitoring. both groups were homogeneous in all clinical and endoscopic parameters. no differences in blood transfusion units, time of hospitalization, the lowest hematocrit measured, and mortality rates were observed between the groups. however, omeprazole reduced the number of rebleeding episodes (p = .) and the need for surgery (.% vs. .%; p = .). omeprazole also reduced the amount of time the gastric ph was < (. +/- .% vs. . +/- .%, p < .). we conclude that parenteral omeprazole is much more effective than ranitidine in keeping the gastric ph above the proteolytic range for pepsin in bleeders and that this might explain a better outcome in a subset of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers treated with parenteral omeprazole."

"how to achieve a near % cure rate for h. pylori infection in peptic ulcer patients. a personal viewpoint. infection with helicobacter pylori is the main etiological factor in duodenal and gastric ulcer disease, and eradication of the organism cures peptic ulcer disease. cure of the infection therefore has become the ultimate treatment goal in ulcer patients. only therapies that achieve a > % cure rate should be used in clinical practice and, as in any other disease, the therapy with the highest cure rates should be used. bismuth-based triple therapy is considered the gold standard; it has been used successfully in many studies, usually with good tolerability on the part of patients. many physicians have been hesitant to prescribe this therapy. the regimen is complex, and it is thought to have many side effects. several groups have shown that concomitant therapy with a proton pump inhibitor increases efficacy and lessens side effects. moreover, it has become clear that the duration of treatment can be decreased to just days. with this adjustment it now seems sensible to use this short -day quadruple therapy, which at present has superior cure rates when compared with any other anti-helicobacter therapy. this article is a plea for the use of this regimen and gives practical advice about how to employ therapy in general practice. suggestions are made about how to motivate a patient to comply with the therapy prescribed. if these suggestions are followed, good compliance seems possible, and a near % cure rate will be within reach."

"pathogenesis and treatment of acid peptic disorders: comparison of proton pump inhibitors with other antiulcer agents. acid peptic disorders, including gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, are commonly occurring conditions with high direct and indirect costs. the pathogenesis of these disorders involves an imbalance between acid secretion and gastric mucosal defenses. pharmacologic treatment of acid peptic disorders has focused on correcting this imbalance by either improving mucosal defenses with drugs such as sucralfate, bismuth, and prostaglandin analogs, neutralizing acid with antacids, or decreasing acid secretion with histamine (h)-receptor antagonists, or, more recently, proton pump inhibitors. proton pump inhibitors are more potent inhibitors of acid secretion than h-receptor antagonists. in clinical comparisons, proton pump inhibitors were shown to be more effective in the treatment of acid peptic disorders than h-receptor antagonists. helicobacter pylori infection is a factor in % to % of duodenal ulcers and % to % of gastric ulcers; eradicating this organism results in a considerable decrease in the recurrence of ulcers. current management of peptic ulcer disease includes the use of combination antisecretory and antibiotic therapy for acute treatment of h pylori-associated disease. patient self-medication with over-the-counter products, including h-receptor antagonists, may have an impact on the potential for reducing the recurrence of peptic ulcer disease in patients with h pylori infection. patients with recurrent disease should be informed of the need to seek medical treatment through aggressive education at the point of sale for over-the-counter drugs."
"how to treat helicobacter pylori infection--should treatment strategies be based on testing bacterial susceptibility? a personal viewpoint. peptic ulcer disease is an infectious disease. only antibiotic regimens that achieve a % cure should be used to treat this infection. antimicrobial susceptibility is the main determinant in the success of therapy; cure rates are usually lower in resistant strains. as in any other infectious disease it is essential in treatment studies to stratify results according to pretreatment bacterial susceptibility. cure-rates have to be reported separately for sensitive and resistant strains. it must be realized that a study achieving a high cure rate with a certain regimen can either have included few patients with resistant strains or, alternatively, the regimen tested can have a high efficacy in resistant strains. this issue is fundamental and only if that information is available, do we know whether or not we can reproduce the results reported in that particular study in a different population. we have reviewed all helicobacter studies that tested pretreatment bacterial susceptibility. the results achieved with dual therapy, bismuth triple therapy, proton pump inhibitor triple therapy and quadruple therapy in sensitive and resistant strains are discussed. based on these data, treatment recommendations are made for empirical treatment in areas with low resistance rates and those with high resistance rates. if treatment is individualized and based on the antibiogram then easier, shorter and cheaper regimens seem possible."

long-term follow-up after cure of helicobacter pylori infection with days of quadruple therapy. we have shown that days of quadruple therapy after omeprazole pre-treatment is an effective therapy for curing h. pylori infection. in this study we investigated whether this regimen would maintain the high cure rate during long-term follow-up. some recent studies have reported high recurrence rates after apparent cure. apparently not all methods to test for cure have sufficient sensitivity to pick up small numbers of residual bacteria. this study also served to investigate whether our methods to test for cure - weeks post-treatment were reliable.
a randomized blinded comparison of omeprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of chronic esophageal stricture secondary to acid peptic esophagitis. esophageal strictures due to gastroesophageal reflux disease are often resistant to medical therapy and require repeated dilation procedures. our aim was to compare the efficacy of therapy with omeprazole ( mg/day) to ranitidine ( mg twice daily) in the treatment of chronic esophageal strictures.
prevention of peptic ulcer and dyspeptic symptoms with omeprazole in patients receiving continuous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. a nordic multicentre study. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are known to cause gastroduodenal lesions and dyspeptic symptoms.
"a review on treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer: a collaborative task of gastroenterologist and surgeon. the majority of patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage bleed from peptic diseases erosive gastritis and duodenal or gastric ulcers. early gastroscopy is essential in order to reach a diagnosis, assess the prognosis, and institute appropriate therapy. in a meta-analysis it was shown that h-antagonists significantly reduced mortality. however, two large, prospective and placebo-controlled studies with famotidine and omeprazole failed to show reduction of rebleeding or death. the value of endoscopic haemostatic therapy in patients with high-risk peptic ulcers (active bleeding and non-bleeding visible vessel) has been firmly established with % decrease in rebleeding and operation rate, and a % reduction in mortality. risk factors for an adverse outcome are: elderly patients, concomitant diseases and large ulcers in the posterior duodenal bulb or on the lesser curvature. the mortality for emergency surgery in upper gi bleeding is still -%. the mortality of elective operations is less than %. some studies have reduced mortality by avoiding emergency surgery through early elective surgery in high-risk patients."
"advances in the use of somatostatins in the management of endocrine tumors. with the introduction of long-acting somatostatin analogues, several advances have been made in the management of endocrine tumors. octreotide was first used for the management of acromegaly and later used for metastatic gastroenteropancreatic tumors. somatostatin receptor imaging has recently been introduced not only for the localization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors but also for selection of optimal therapy. in addition to inhibitory effects on exocrine and endocrine secretion, octreotide has also been suggested to have antiproliferative effects manifested mainly by stabilization of disease and not tumor regression."
"the use of omeprazole for resistant oesophagitis in children. following failure of conventional therapy for reflux oesophagitis, children were treated with omeprazole mg daily for a period of up to three months initially. treatment resulted in a marked symptomatic improvement as measured by incidence of pain, vomiting, dysphagia and haematemesis. four children failed treatment and required fundoplication. no complications from the use of omeprazole were recorded and some children have continued long-term treatment."
bacterial overgrowth during treatment with omeprazole compared with cimetidine: a prospective randomised double blind study. gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth frequently occurs in conditions where diminished acid secretion is present. omeprazole inhibits acid secretion more effectively than cimetidine and might therefore more frequently cause bacterial overgrowth.
"pantoprazole. a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in acid-related disorders. pantoprazole is an irreversible proton pump inhibitor which, at the therapeutic dose of mg, effectively reduces gastric acid secretion. in controlled clinical trials, pantoprazole (mg once daily) has proved superior to ranitidine (mg once daily or mg twice daily) and equivalent to omeprazole (mg once daily) in the short term (< or = weeks) treatment of acute peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. gastric and duodenal ulcer healing proceeded significantly faster with pantoprazole than with ranitidine, and at similar rates with pantoprazole and omeprazole. the time course of gastric ulcer pain relief was similar with pantoprazole, ranitidine and omeprazole, whereas duodenal ulcer pain was alleviated more rapidly with pantoprazole than ranitidine. pantoprazole (mg once daily) showed superior efficacy to famotidine (mg once daily) in ulcer healing and pain relief after weeks in patients with duodenal ulcer in a large multicentre nonblinded study. in mild to moderate acute reflux oesophagitis, significantly greater healing was obtained with pantoprazole than with ranitidine and famotidine, whereas similar healing rates were seen with pantoprazole and omeprazole. pantoprazole showed a significant advantage over ranitidine in relieving symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation. reflux symptoms were similarly alleviated by pantoprazole and omeprazole. preliminary results indicate that triple therapy with pantoprazole, clarithromycin and either metronidazole or tinidazole is effective in the treatment of helicobacter pylori-associated disease; however, these findings require confirmation in large well-controlled studies. pantoprazole appears to be well tolerated during short term oral administration, with diarrhoea (.%), headache (.%), dizziness (.%), pruritus (.%) and skin rash (.%) representing the most frequent adverse events. the drug has lower affinity than omeprazole or lansoprazole for hepatic cytochrome p and shows no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions at therapeutic doses with a wide range of drug substrates for this isoenzyme system. in conclusion, pantoprazole is superior to ranitidine and as effective as omeprazole in the short term treatment of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis, has shown efficacy when combined with antibacterial agents in h. pylori eradication, is apparently well tolerated and offers the potential advantage of minimal risk of drug interaction."

"gastroesophageal reflux disease. the long and the short of therapeutic options. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a common and treatable condition. initial therapy includes lifestyle modifications, avoidance of certain medications, and use of antacids, alginic acid preparations, and over-the-counter histamine (h) receptor antagonists. escalation of therapy for acute disease relies primarily on h receptor antagonists given in conventional dosages. although h receptor antagonists remain the cornerstone of therapy, sucralfate and promotility agents, especially cisapride, may offer alternatives. most cases of gerd that are resistant to these therapies can be reliably healed with proton pump inhibitors (ppis). patients whose gerd is healed with one of the aforementioned agents often relapse unless they receive further therapy. for patients with mild disease, h receptor antagonists, cisapride, or a combination of the two may prevent recurrent symptoms. in severe disease, ppis are the agents of first choice, but concerns about the safety of long-term use must be considered. in selected patients, surgery offers an option for long-term control of gerd. with present surgical techniques, symptom relief can be obtained with little risk of complications."

"randomised controlled trial of ranitidine versus omeprazole in combination with antibiotics for eradication of helicobacter pylori. this study compared high dose ranitidine versus low dose omeprazole with antibiotics for the eradication of h pylori. patients (mean age years, range -) who had h pylori infection were randomised in an investigator-blind manner to either a two-week regime of omeprazole mg daily, amoxycillin mg tid and metronidazole mg tid (oam), or ranitidine mg bd, amoxycillin mg tid and metronidazole mg tid (ram), or omeprazole mg daily and clarithromycin mg tid (oc), or omeprazole mg daily and placebo (op). h pylori was eradicated in of patients in the oam group (%); of in the ram group (%), of in the oc group (%); none of in the op group (%). [< p. for oam, ram, oc vs op; p = n.s. between oam, ram, oc]. overall metronidazole resistance was unexpectedly high at %. eradication rates in metronidazole sensitive patients were % (/) and % (/) for oam and ram respectively. in conclusion, h pylori eradication rates using high dose ranitidine plus amoxycillin and metronidazole may be similar to that of low dose omeprazole in combination with the same antibiotics for omeprazole with clarithromycin. overall eradication rates were low due to a high incidence of metronidazole resistance but were higher in metronidazole-sensitive patients. even high dose ranitidine with two antibiotics achieves a relatively low eradication rate. these metronidazole-based regimens cannot be recommended in areas with a high incidence of metronidazole resistance."

"evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of four different therapeutic regimens for the helicobacter pylori eradication. the aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of four different therapeutic regimens for helicobacter pylori eradication. one-hundred and thirty-two consecutive patients suffering from either peptic ulcer or non-ulcer dyspepsia, with helicobacter pylori infection, were allocated to one of the following groups with different therapeutic regimens: a) omeprazole mg bid for days/amoxycillin mg bid for days/tinidazole mg bid for days ( patients, with peptic ulcer); b) omeprazole mg bid for days/amoxycillin mg bid for days ( patients, with peptic ulcer); c) omeprazole mg bid for days/azithromycin mg/day for days for consecutive weeks ( patients, with peptic ulcer); d) omeprazole mg/day for days/clarithromycin mg bid for days/tinidazole mg bid for days/ ( patients, with peptic ulcer). the helicobacter pylori status was evaluated by means of histology, culture and urease test, at entry and weeks after treatment. group a, b and d patients, d patient didn't complete the treatment. in evaluable patients, the helicobacter pylori eradication was obtained in patients of group a (.%), in of group b (.%), in of group c (.%) and in of group d (.%). on intention-to-treat analysis, helicobacter pylori eradication was % in group a, .% in group b, % in group d and .% in group d. sideeffects occurred in patients of group a (.%), in of group b (.%), in group d (.%) and none of group c. in conclusion, triple therapy with omeprazole/clarithro-mycin/tinidazole is better for cost/benefit ratio; omeprazole/amoxycillin/tinidazole is more effective than others regimens in the helicobacter pylori eradication, but causes more side effects; double therapy with omeprazole/azithromycin is the most tolerable and the least efficacy for helicobacter pylori eradication."
"contemporary medical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease. gastroesophageal reflux disease is a chronic disorder that requires long-term therapy in most patients. the appropriate medical therapy should be individualized to the severity of symptoms, the degree of esophagitis and the presence of other acid-reflux complications. lifestyle changes should form the basis of any therapeutic approach. in patients with mild to moderate disease, initial therapy with histamine h-receptor antagonists in conventional dosages is suggested. prokinetic agents are potentially useful in patients with impaired esophageal or gastric motor function, but their efficacy as single agents does not appear to surpass that of standard doses of h blockers. sucralfate, a cytoprotective agent, is an additional therapeutic option. for patients with more severe disease, omeprazole and lansoprazole provide unequaled healing rates and accelerated symptom relief. in most patients, maintenance therapy is vital. surgery is indicated in patients whose disease is refractory to medical therapy and in those who develop complications not amenable to medical therapy."
"marked increase in gastric acid secretory capacity after omeprazole treatment. in contrast with the histamine (h) blockers, proton pump inhibitors have not been shown to give rebound hypersecretion of acid. taking into consideration the hyperplasia of the enterochromaffin-like (ecl) cell provoked by hypergastrinaemia secondary to profound acid inhibition and the central role of histamine from ecl cells in the regulation of acid secretion, the lack of any rebound acid hypersecretion after treatment with proton pump inhibitors has been questioned."
"scleroderma and pregnancy. pregnancy in systemic sclerosis may be uneventful, with both good maternal and fetal outcomes. because scleroderma is a multisystem disease and complications do occur, however, careful antenatal evaluations, discussion of potential problems, and participation in a high-risk obstetric monitoring program is very important to optimize the best outcome. because women with diffuse scleroderma are at greater risk for developing serious cardiopulmonary and renal problems early in the disease, they should be encouraged to delay pregnancy until the disease stabilizes. all patients who become pregnant during this high-risk time should be monitored extremely carefully. although there are some suggestions that there are increases in infertility and miscarriages before disease onset, recent studies show that these issues probably do not have major impact for women with established scleroderma who plan to become pregnant. the high risk of premature and small infants may be minimized with specialized obstetric and neonatal care, however. renal crisis in scleroderma is the only truly unique aspect of these pregnant, which, unlike blood pressure elevation in nonscleroderma pregnancies, must be treated aggressively with ace inhibitors. other pregnancy problems may not be unique to scleroderma, but because it is a chronic illness, any complication carries higher risks for both mother and child. careful planning, close monitoring, and aggressive management should allow women with scleroderma to have a high likelihood of a successful pregnancy."

"omeprazole, amoxicillin and bismuth for peptic ulcer healing and helicobacter pylori eradication. a controlled, randomized study was performed in patients with active peptic ulcer disease and positive helicobacter pylori (hp) status to assess the clinical efficacy (endoscopic healing and eradication of hp) of different combined treatments. in the first part of the study a treatment with omeprazole (cas --) ( mg once daily) alone (group a) or in combination with tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (tdb; mg bid, group b) for weeks was evaluated in and patients, respectively. as expected healing rates were high and comparable ( vs. %), however, hp-eradication was zero in both groups. in the subsequent second part of the trial group a (n = ) received omeprazole ( mg bid) for weeks + amoxicillin (cas --) tablets ( g bid only nd week). accumulated healing rate increased to % but hp-eradication was %. from group b only patients participated in a second -week course of monotherapy with tdb. whereas healing occurred in all individuals, hp-eradication was still low (.%). in addition plasma levels (omeprazole, bi) and urinary excretion (bi) were monitored to test whether drug interaction and/or noncompliance of the patients could help to explain the clinical findings. systemic availability of bi was increased by the coadministration of omeprazole and plasma levels of omeprazole were in general higher in hp-positive patients if compared to those of hp-negative patients. the following conclusions could be drawn from the parts of the study: treatment of peptic ulcer disease with omeprazole either alone or in combination with tdb is effective for ulcer healing but not for eradicating hp. omeprazole seems to decrease the hp-eradicating potential of bi probably due to a drug interaction. a second treatment course with tdb is apparently not of much benefit. one week pretreatment with omeprazole does not affect healing but might attenuate hp-eradication rate of subsequent combined treatment with amoxicillin. one week coadministration of amoxicillin is not sufficient. the magnitude of omeprazole's plasma levels has no effect on hp-eradication rates. as the numbers of patients in this study was relatively small these conclusions need to be confirmed by larger trials."

"guilty as charged: bugs and drugs in gastric ulcer. gastric ulcer disease remains a cause of hemorrhage, perforation, outlet obstruction, and death. recent advances in the understanding of peptic ulcer disease indicate that infection with helicobacter pylori and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are the cause of almost all gastric and duodenal ulcers. our therapy, therefore, is in a state of transition: the old acid-suppressive temporary therapy that allows frequent ulcer recurrences and complications is being replaced by curative therapies. the old therapy, by reducing gastric acid secretion or enhancing gastric mucosal defenses, inhibited the cofactors needed for ulcer development. acid suppression relieved symptoms and healed ulcers, while defense enhancers, such as prostaglandin analogs healed and prevented acute nsaid-induced gastric ulcers. these benefits were maintained, however, only as long as acid-reducing agents or mucosal defense enhancers were continued. on the other hand, curative therapies (such as eradicating h. pylori infection and/or stopping the use of nsaids) eliminate the causes of ulcer. curative combination regimens consisting of antibiotics, ranitidine bismuth citrate, bismuth, and proton pump inhibitors have been approved by the food and drug administration. these new regimens can cure benign gastric ulcer. unfortunately, we cannot always determine which gastric ulcers are benign, and concern about gastric cancer remains. all gastric ulcers therefore still require biopsy and histological examination. with new treatment regimens, the time may be rapidly approaching when ulcer disease will be ""history."""

influence of a proton pump inhibitor-based therapy on helicobacter pylori strain selection. the influence of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole on strain diversity in helicobacter pylori infected patients was investigated. multiple isolates of helicobacter pylori obtained pre- and post-therapy from gastric antral and body biopsies in patients were compared using the random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) for analysis. post-therapy strains exhibiting novel rapd-profiles were found in of patients ( of patients treated with lansoprazole alone and of patients treated with lansoprazole plus amoxicillin). proton pump inhibition may affect the microecology of the stomach by influencing the colonisation patterns of specific strains.
"current european concepts in the management of helicobacter pylori infection. the maastricht consensus report. european helicobacter pylori study group. there is considerable confusion over the management of helicobacter pylori infection, particularly among primary care physicians, and numerous european countries lack national guidelines in this rapidly growing area of medicine. the european helicobacter pylori study group therefore organised a meeting in maastricht of h pylori experts, primary care physicians and representatives of national societies of gastroenterology from europe to establish consensus guidelines on the management of h pylori at the primary care and specialist levels, and to consider general health care issues associated with the infection. as in previous guidelines, eradication therapy was recommended in all h pylori positive patients with peptic ulcer disease. additionally, at the primary care level in dyspeptic patients < years old and with no alarm symptoms, diagnosis is recommended by non-invasive means (c urea breath test, serology) and if h pylori positive the patient should be treated. moreover, at the specialist level the indications for eradication of h pylori were also broadened to include h pylori positive patients with functional dyspepsia in whom no other possible causes of symptoms are identified by the specialist (after a full investigation including endoscopy, ultrasound and other necessary investigations), patients with low grade gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (malt) lymphoma (managed in specialised centres) and those with gastritis with severe macro- or microscopic abnormalities. there was consensus that treatment regimens should be simple, well tolerated and achieve an eradication rate of over % on an intention to treat basis. it was strongly recommended, therefore, that eradication treatment should be with proton pump inhibitor based triple therapy for seven days, using a proton pump inhibitor and two of the following: clarithromycin, a nitroimidazole (metronidazole or tinidazole) and amoxycillin."

"lansoprazole. an update of its pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy in the management of acid-related disorders. lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion. it has proved effective in combination regimens for the eradication of helicobacter pylori and as monotherapy to heal and relieve symptoms of gastric or duodenal ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux. after initial healing, it may be used to prevent recurrence of oesophageal erosions or peptic ulcers in patients in whom h. pylori is not the major cause of ulceration and to reduce basal acid output in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome. usual dosages are to mg/day, although dosages of < or = mg/day have been used in patients with hypersecretory states. in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer, short term lansoprazole monotherapy was similar to omeprazole and superior to histamine h receptor antagonists in achieving healing rates > %. lansoprazole was as effective a component of h. pylori eradication regimens as omeprazole, tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (colloidal bismuth subcitrate) or ranitidine. lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine in symptom relief and healing of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and tended to relieve symptoms more rapidly than omeprazole, although initial healing was similar. as maintenance treatment, lansoprazole was similar to omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in relieving symptoms and preventing relapse. lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in healing and relieving symptoms of oesophageal erosions associated with barrett's oesophagus; healing was maintained for a mean of . years in > or = % of patients. lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in prophylaxis of redilatation of oesophageal strictures. after > or = years of use in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome, lansoprazole to mg/day effectively controlled basal acid output. dosages may be reduced in some patients once healing and symptom relief has been achieved. preliminary studies of lansoprazole in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia or stress ulcers show promise. although studies show lansoprazole is potentially effective in treating gastrointestinal bleeding, future studies should assess patients' h. pylori status. lansoprazole has been well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea appearing to be the most common adverse effects. tolerability of lansoprazole does not deteriorate with age and the drug is well tolerated in long term use (< or = years) in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome or reflux disease. thus, lansoprazole is an important alternative to omeprazole and h receptor antagonists in acid-related disorders. in addition to its efficacy in healing or maintenance treatment, it may provide more effective symptom relief than other comparator agents."

"review article: current practice and future perspectives in the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is primarily due to incompetence of the lower oesophageal sphincter (los) and crural diaphragm, with transient los relaxation frequently accounting for daytime reflux. in the absence of drugs that adequately correct the motility defects of gerd, treatment is directed towards decreasing gastric acidity. oesophageal healing is related to control of -h intragastric acidity, the degree of acid suppression and duration of treatment. h-receptor antagonists are generally less effective in gerd than in peptic ulcer disease. while providing symptomatic relief in non-erosive gerd, they are often ineffective in healing erosive oesophagitis. proton pump inhibitors provide more rapid and complete healing and symptom resolution. they are superior to h-receptor antagonists in the long-term management of erosive oesophagitis and in reducing recurrence of oesophageal stricture following mechanical dilatation. in barrett's oesophagus, high-dose proton pump inhibitors in combination with laser/photodynamic ablation therapy can produce metaplastic regression, although this does not preclude future emergence of adenocarcinoma. surgical morbidity and mortality rates in gerd generally remain higher than those associated with long-term pharmacotherapy. however, direct comparisons between laparascopic anti-reflux surgery and proton pump inhibitor maintenance therapy remain to be performed. although there is no evidence that h. pylori infection worsens the severity of oesophagitis or that h. pylori is carcinogenic in the metaplastic oesophageal mucosa. it has been suggested that h. pylori-positive patients requiring long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy receive bacterial eradication therapy to reduce the risk of developing atrophic gastritis."

"identification, diagnosis, and treatment of acid-related diseases in the elderly: implications for long-term care. acid-related disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease occur frequently in the elderly and are associated with a high frequency of morbidity and mortality. the proton pump inhibitors lansoprazole and omeprazole produce faster rates of healing and greater symptomatic relief in patients with acid-related disorders than histamine-receptor antagonists, are well tolerated, and are associated with few adverse events. compared with omeprazole, which interacts with diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin, lansoprazole produces only a minor increase in theophylline clearance. proton pump inhibitors in combination with antibiotic therapy can eradicate helicobacter pylori, the main risk factor in the recurrence of peptic ulcer disease, obviating the need for maintenance therapy. long-term acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors may be necessary to prevent the recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. the safety and efficacy profile of these agents makes them ideal for the treatment of acid-related diseases in elderly patients."
"current guidelines on stress ulcer prophylaxis. acute uppergastrointestinal bleeding in intensive care unit (icu) patients may occur due to peptic ulcer disease, adverse drug effects, gastric tube lesions, acute renal failure, liver failure or stress-induced gastric mucosal lesions. gastric acid hypersecretion can be observed in patients with head trauma or neurosurgical procedures. gastric mucosal ischaemia due to hypotension and shock is the most important risk factor for stress ulcer bleeding. preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (histamine h receptor antagonists, antacids), strengthen mucosal defensive mechanisms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and normalise gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine). however, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimised resuscitation and icu regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation. all drugs approved for stress ulcer prophylaxis in europe (h antagonists, antacids, pirenzepine, sucralfate) have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled randomised trials. however, due to insufficient clinical data, prostaglandins and omeprazole cannot be recommended for this use. stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated only in patients at risk, and not in every icu patient. the selection of drugs today depends not only on efficacy but also on possible adverse effects and on costs. in this regard, the most cost-effective drug is sucralfate. the clinical relevance of nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric bacterial overgrowth has decreased during the past decade due to several changes in the management of critically ill patients."
"parietal cell protrusions in gastric ulcer disease. oxyntic mucosal biopsy specimens from patients receiving omeprazole therapy have been described as frequently showing characteristic tonguelike protrusions of parietal cell cytoplasm (pcp) into the gland lumen. although protrusion of parietal cell cytoplasm is believed to be associated with omeprazole therapy and has been implicated in the histogenesis of fundic gland polyps, we have observed it in a wide variety of different conditions unrelated to peptic ulcer disease or omeprazole therapy. to establish the incidence of pcp and analyze its relationship to gastritis, gland dilatation, cystic change, and fundic gland polyps, we studied gastric mucosal biopsy specimens from gastric ulcer patients who were not receiving omeprazole therapy and who did not receive any medications for at least weeks. severity of each of these changes was graded on a scale of i to iii. pcp was observed in oxyntic mucosal biopsy specimens from (%) patients and was associated with varying grades of chronic superficial or interstitial gastritis in (helicobacter pylori was identified in ). although chronic atrophic gastritis, cystic change, or fundic gland polyps were not identified in any of the cases with pcp, gland dilatation was present in of (%) biopsy specimens. no consistent linear correlation was observed between increasing grades of pcp and gastritis or gland dilatation. our findings of pcp in % of gastric ulcer patients who were off all medications for weeks indicate that pcp is not always related to omeprazole usage. it appears to be a change encountered in a wide variety of diverse settings and, therefore, should not be used to monitor omeprazole therapy. in gastric ulcer patients, there is no linear correlation between pcp and gland dilatation or severity of gastritis. the lack of association of pcp with such cardinal features of fundic gland polyps as gland dilatation and cystic change suggests that pcp per se has little if any role in the development of such polyps. the exact clinical and functional significance of pcp remain to be established and merits further investigation."

"sample size calculation in economic evaluations. a simulation method is presented for sample size calculation in economic evaluations. as input the method requires: the expected difference and variance of costs and effects, their correlation, the significance level (alpha) and the power of the testing method and the maximum acceptable ratio of incremental effectiveness to incremental costs. the method is illustrated with data from two trials. the first compares primary coronary angioplasty with streptokinase in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, in the second trial, lansoprazole is compared with omeprazole in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. these case studies show how the various parameters influence the sample size. given the large number of parameters that have to be specified in advance, the lack of knowledge about costs and their standard deviation, and the difficulty of specifying the maximum acceptable ratio of incremental effectiveness to incremental costs, the conclusion of the study is that from a technical point of view it is possible to perform a sample size calculation for an economic evaluation, but one should wonder how useful it is."
"efficacy of tetracycline and metronidazole alone or with ranitidine on the healing of duodenal ulcer and eradication of helicobacter pylori. a randomized controlled multicenter study. tetra-metro-ran study group. in almost all eradication regimens, which contain antibiotics and bismuth derivatives, the administration of acid suppressing drugs for - weeks is recommended for healing of duodenal ulcer. the aim of this multicenter double blind study is to elucidate the effect of two classic antibiotics tetracycline (cas --) and metronidazole (cas --) alone or combined with ranitidine (cas --) on the healing of duodenal ulcer and eradication of helicobacter pylori. patients with duodenal ulcer were randomized to two treatment groups: group a received either ranitidine x mg or tetracycline x mg or metronidazole x mg for weeks. group b received x placebo + tetracycline and metronidazole as in group a for weeks. a final endoscopy was performed after weeks. four biopsy specimens were obtained from the antrum (two) and corpus (two) for both urease test and hematoxylin stain for detection of h. pylori. out of patients entering the study completed the study ( in a and in b). the healing rate of duodenal ulcer was .% in group a and . in group b. the eradication rate was only .% in group b but % in group a (p < .), when additionally ranitidine was given. the present study shows that treatment with the two antibiotics tetracycline and metronidazole alone results in a very low h. pylori eradication, but almost complete healing of duodenal ulcer after weeks. prolonged administration of antisecretory drugs in eradication regimens containing two antibiotics is not necessary for duodenal ulcer healing. however, the addition of h-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors to antibiotics increases the eradication rate."

"acid peptic diseases in the era of helicobacter pylori. the treatment of peptic ulcers has been revolutionized by the discovery that helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) bacteria is a causative agent for ulcer formation. however, when patients present with dyspepsia or epigastric discomfort, more than % of patients will not have ulcer disease and empiric treatment of h. pylori is not recommended for these patients. eradication of h. pylori has not been demonstrated to improve the symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia compared with non-ulcer dyspepsia patients treated with placebo. therefore, we recommend that patients should first be evaluated for peptic ulcers with endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal series before the diagnosis and treatment of h. pylori. generally, the treatment of h. pylori should be limited to patients with peptic ulcers, mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, and gastric cancers. most diagnostic tests for h. pylori, including quantitative igg antibody, urea breath tests, rapid urease tests (clo), tests of gastric mucosal biopsies, and staining of gastric mucosal biopsies, have equivalent diagnostic characteristics. therefore, the choice of diagnostic test for h. pylori should be based on cost, ease of use, and lack of complications. multiple antibiotic regimens are available for the treatment of h. pylori. triple antibiotic therapy is the least expensive but has the highest rate of side effects and the least compliance. combining a proton pump inhibitor with clarithromycin and another antibiotic will eradicate h. pylori with fewer side effects and better compliance but this is the most expensive antibiotic regimen."

"proton pump inhibitors. pharmacology and rationale for use in gastrointestinal disorders. proton pump inhibitors (ppis) are drugs which irreversibly inhibit proton pump (h+/k+ atpase) function and are the most potent gastric acid-suppressing agents in clinical use. there is now a substantial body of evidence showing improved efficacy of ppis over the histamine h receptor antagonists and other drugs in acid-related disorders. omeprazole mg/day, lansoprazole mg/day, pantoprazole mg/day or rabeprazole mg/day for to weeks are more effective than standard doses of h-receptor antagonists in healing duodenal and gastric ulcers. patients with gastric ulcers should receive standard doses of ppis as for duodenal ulcers but for a longer time period ( to weeks). there is no conclusive evidence to support the use of a particular ppi over another for either duodenal or gastric ulcer healing. for helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulceration, a combination of a ppi and antibacterials will eradicate h. pylori in over % of cases and significantly reduce ulcer recurrence. patients with h. pylori-positive gastric ulcers should be managed similarly. ppis also have efficacy advantages over ranitidine and misoprostol and are better tolerated than misoprostol in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). in endoscopically proven gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, standard daily doses of the ppis are more effective than h-receptor antagonists for healing, and patients should receive a to week course of treatment. for severe reflux, with ulceration and/or stricture formation, a higher dose regimen (omeprazole mg, lansoprazole mg, pantoprazole mg or rabeprazole mg daily) appears to yield better healing rates. there is little evidence that ppis lead to resolution of barrett's oesophagus or a reduction of subsequent adenocarcinoma development, but ppis are indicated in healing of any associated ulceration. in zollinger-ellison syndrome, ppis have become the treatment of choice for the management of gastric acid hypersecretion."

"correlation of ambulatory -hour esophageal ph monitoring results with symptom improvement in patients with noncardiac chest pain due to gastroesophageal reflux disease. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) accounts for up to % of patients with noncardiac chest pain (nccp). twenty-four-hour esophageal ph monitoring has been considered the most sensitive test for identifying acid reflux as the probable cause for chest pain. it is unclear if there is a correlation between the degree of esophageal acid exposure as determined by -hour esophageal ph monitoring and symptom improvement during a short course of high-dose omeprazole (the omeprazole test) in patients with nccp due to gerd. twenty-three patients with gerd-related nccp were studied. all patients were referred by a cardiologist and evaluated by upper endoscopy and -hour esophageal ph monitoring. diagnosis of gerd was defined by one or both tests being abnormal. subsequently, patients underwent baseline symptom intensity assessment during week off therapy followed by week on therapy with high-dose omeprazole ( mg a.m. and mg p.m.). there was a statistically significant correlation between the esophageal acid exposure by -hour esophageal ph monitoring and the change in symptom intensity score after treatment. however, there was no significant correlation between the ph values and symptom intensity score during baseline or during the omeprazole test. in patients with gerd-related nccp undergoing the omeprazole test, -hour esophageal ph monitoring has a therapeutic predictive value in addition to its diagnostic merit. patients with greater esophageal acid exposure appear to have a greater response to antireflux treatment."
"the second canadian gastroesophageal reflux disease consensus: moving forward to new concepts. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a disease with serious consequences that may result in significant impairment in quality of life and disease morbidity. across all grades of severity of symptoms and severity of underlying esophageal disease, proton pump inhibitors (ppis) provide therapeutic gains over prokinetics (pks) or h receptor antagonists (hras). the potential cost effectiveness of using medications with higher acquisition costs that may lower health care costs overall is often disregarded when conducting cost comparisons with medications having lower 'up-front' costs. limiting therapy to less effective agents condemns many patients to protracted suffering, repeated physician visits and needless reinvestigation of symptoms that could have been resolved by appropriate initial therapy. based on current data, use of any classification of symptom severity as a basis for selecting one class of therapeutic agents over another for first line therapy (i.e. pks, hras for 'mild' gerd, versus a ppi for 'severe' disease) is unwarranted."
"treatment with proton pump inhibitors induces tolerance to histamine- receptor antagonists in helicobacter pylori-negative patients. treatment with h receptor antagonists (hras) and proton pump inhibitors (ppis) induces hypergastrinemia and causes rebound hypersecretion of gastric acid after treatment, and during treatment with hras tolerance develops. in the present study we investigated whether a treatment period with a ppi induced tolerance to an hra."
"classification of dyspepsia. identification of independent symptom components in consecutive, unselected dyspepsia patients from general practice. several attempts to classify dyspepsia into subgroups have been proposed as a basis for empirical treatment and research. however, subgrouping has proved difficult due to overlap of symptoms between subgroups, and the response to empirical therapy is difficult to predict. we aimed to study whether natural symptom combinations occur in patients seeing general practitioners because of dyspepsia and whether symptom presentation could predict the effect of proton pump inhibitor treatment."
