"rabeprazole: pharmacokinetics in patients with stable, compensated cirrhosis. this single-center, open-label study was undertaken to compare the tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of rabeprazole, a new proton-pump inhibitor (ppi), in healthy volunteers and in subjects with chronic cirrhosis. thirteen healthy men and men with stable, compensated cirrhosis documented by biopsy or liver/spleen scan received a single -mg rabeprazole dose. blood samples were drawn before and up to hours after drug administration for the determination of plasma rabeprazole concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography. adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical findings, and clinical laboratory test results were monitored before and during treatment to determine how rabeprazole was tolerated. chronic liver disease substantially altered the pharmacokinetic profile of rabeprazole. the maximum rabeprazole concentration (+/- sd) in subjects with cirrhosis (+/- ng/ml) was approximately % higher than that in the healthy volunteers (+/- ng/ml), and both area under the curve and elimination half-life were increased by approximately %. oral clearance in subjects with cirrhosis was % of that in the healthy volunteers. rabeprazole was well tolerated by both groups. three subjects reported a total of clinical adverse events that were judged as definitely or possibly related to rabeprazole treatment. some minor changes in laboratory values were judged to be clinically insignificant. in patients with mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction, clearance of this ppi, as with other members of the class, was markedly reduced and plasma levels were increased. although caution is always warranted in patients with severe liver disease, drug accumulation is unlikely with rabeprazole mg once daily, and dose adjustment does not appear to be indicated in patients with mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction."

"eradication of helicobacter pylori infection with proton pump-based triple therapy in patients in whom bismuth-based triple therapy failed. to study the effects of treatment of helicobacter pylori infection in a hyperendemic population, infected patients from the region of nario, colombia, were treated for weeks with clarithromycin ( mg twice a day), amoxicillin ( g twice a day), and either lansoprazole ( mg twice a day) or omeprazole ( mg twice a day). all patients belong to a low socioeconomic strata, had multifocal atrophic gastritis documented by gastric biopsies, and had been treated previously and unsuccessfully for weeks with bismuth subsalicylate ( mg four times a day), amoxicillin ( mg three times a day), and metronidazole ( mg three times a day). c-urea breath tests were performed , , , and weeks after completing therapy. the c-urea breath test was negative in .% of patients month after finishing therapy, and in .% of patients year after finishing treatment. there were no differences in eradication rates between patients treated with omeprazole versus lansoprazole. dyspepsia symptoms decreased from % in patients at baseline to % at the time of finishing treatment. in low-socioeconomic status populations with hyperendemic infection, triple therapy using omeprazole or lansoprazole plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin is an effective alternative when previous standard bismuth-based triple therapy has failed."
"pharmacokinetic interaction between acetaminophen and lansoprazole. because of its minimal gastric toxicity, acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice for patients with gastric acid-related disorders. because proton pump inhibitors are widely used, concomitant prescription of acetaminophen and lansoprazole would be prevalent. this crossover study was conducted to investigate an acetaminophen-lansoprazole interaction. on one occasion, each of six healthy, fasted, male volunteers ingested . g acetaminophen dissolved in ml water. on another occasion, at least week apart, mg lansoprazole was administered orally, simultaneously with acetaminophen, after pretreatment with the same dose of lansoprazole once daily for days. plasma acetaminophen concentrations were measured at , ., ., ., , , , , and hours after dosing. the peak plasma concentration of acetaminophen and the time to its occurrence were significantly higher and shorter, respectively, during the lansoprazole session than during the control session. neither the elimination half-life nor the area under the curve was significantly different between the two sessions. lansoprazole hastens the absorption of acetaminophen solution, but little modifies its elimination rate and bioavailability."

"comparison of ranitidine bismuth citrate plus clarithromycin with omeprazole plus clarithromycin for the eradication of helicobacter pylori. many dual and triple therapy treatment regimens have been proposed for the eradication of helicobacter pylori. however, assessing the relative efficacy of these regimens is complicated by differences in study design, and few well-controlled comparative studies have been reported."
"one-week ranitidine bismuth citrate in combinations with metronidazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin in the treatment of helicobacter pylori infection: the rbc-mach study. we have previously shown that ranitidine bismuth citrate (rbc)-based triple therapy is comparable to proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy in eradicating helicobacter pylori infection."
"comparative treatment of helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer using pantoprazole at low and high doses versus omeprazole in triple therapy. helicobacter pylori eradication has become the standard treatment for peptic ulcer disease. h. pylori-eradicating triple therapy with omeprazole plus two antibiotics has been used until recently; however, the efficacy of pantoprazole and antibiotics for h. pylori eradication has not been researched thoroughly until now. the aim of this randomized clinical trial was to verify the efficacy of triple oral therapy comparing the effects of pantoprazole using two different doses versus omeprazole twice daily in h. pylori eradication, in ulcer healing and relapses, and in gastritis improvement."
"rabeprazole: pharmacokinetics and tolerability in patients with stable, end-stage renal failure. the authors compare the pharmacokinetic profiles, safety, and tolerability of rabeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor (ppi), in healthy volunteers and in subjects with stable, end-stage renal failure. this single-center, open-label trial included two groups of subjects: healthy males with -hour creatinine clearance > or = ml/min/m and males with renal failure (-hour creatinine clearance < or = ml/min/m) receiving hemodialytic therapy. normal subjects received a single, oral mg rabeprazole dose. those with renal failure received a mg dose of rabeprazole on the day after hemodialysis and a second dose after a -week washout period during dialysis. blood samples were drawn before and up to hours after rabeprazole administration for determination of plasma rabeprazole concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography. safety and tolerability of rabeprazole were determined by reporting adverse events and comparing vital signs, ecg, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests before and during treatment. comparison of pharmacokinetic results from healthy volunteers with those from subjects with renal failure indicated no clinically significant differences between groups. in addition, there were no statistically significant differences between any pharmacokinetic parameters recorded during or after hemodialysis. rabeprazole was well tolerated by both groups. only two drug-related adverse events were reported, and there were no significant treatment-emergent changes in vital signs or ecg. treatment-emergent changes in hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters were observed for a few subjects in each group and generally represented only slight deviations from the normal range. these results indicate that no dosage adjustment of rabeprazole is required in patients with renal dysfunction. these findings and the well-documented clinical efficacy of this new ppi in patients with gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, or gastroesophageal reflux disease support rabeprazole's use in the treatment of patients with acid peptic disorders."
"lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between oral pantoprazole and cisapride in healthy adults. pantoprazole, an irreversible proton pump inhibitor, may be administered with cisapride, a prokinetic agent. as increased cisapride concentrations may result in longer electrocardiogram (ecg) qtc intervals, a crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects to evaluate the oral pharmacokinetic interaction between cisapride ( mg) and pantoprazole ( mg). after dosing, serial blood samples and -lead ecgs were collected, and cisapride plasma concentrations were quantitated. for cisapride alone, mean parameter values were the following: peak concentration (cmax), ng/ml; time to cmax (tmax), . hours; area under the concentration-time curve (auc), ng x h/ml; and terminal half-life (t/), . hours. pantoprazole coadministration did not alter cisapride auc or other pharmacokinetic parameters except for a slight % decrease in cmax' resulting in % confidence limits of % to %, which were marginally outside strict bioequivalence limits. in addition, cisapride did not affect ecg qtc intervals, with or without pantoprazole. therefore, no dosage adjustment is needed when pantoprazole and cisapride are coadministered."
"lansoprazole versus omeprazole for duodenal ulcer healing and prevention of relapse: a randomized, multicenter, double-masked trial. the aim of this randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group study was to compare the efficacy of lansoprazole with that of omeprazole monotherapy in duodenal ulcer healing and prevention of relapse. a total of patients with duodenal ulcer were treated with either lansoprazole mg/d (n = ) or omeprazole mg/d (n = ). patients with healed ulcers were then randomly allocated to months of maintenance therapy with lansoprazole mg/d (n = ), lansoprazole mg/d (n = ), or omeprazole mg/d (n = ). healing rates at weeks (intent-to-treat analysis) were .% (% confidence interval [ci], .% to .%) with lansoprazole and .% (% ci, .% to %) with omeprazole; there were no significant differences between groups. endoscopic relapse rates after months were .% (% ci, % to .%) with lansoprazole mg, % with lansoprazole mg, and .% (% ci, .% to .%) with omeprazole mg, compared with .% (% ci, % to .%), %, and .% (% ci, % to .%), respectively, at months. again, there were no significant differences between groups. the incidence of adverse events during acute treatment was .% and .% in the lansoprazole and omeprazole groups, respectively; during maintenance therapy, the incidences were .% (lansoprazole mg), .% (lansoprazole mg), and .% (omeprazole mg). within treatment groups, pain was significantly ameliorated after the acute phase but not after maintenance therapy (p < .); no differences were observed between groups. gastrin values increased significantly after acute therapy (p < .), persisted at these increased levels during maintenance therapy, and returned to normal after -month follow-up. both lansoprazole and omeprazole were highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of duodenal ulcer; relapse rates were similar for all doses studied. thus no additional benefit is to be gained from using a proton-pump inhibitor at a dose > mg lansoprazole to prevent relapse."
"review article: drug interactions with agents used to treat acid-related diseases. patients with acid-related diseases often need to take multiple medications. treatment of helicobacter pylori infection often includes either a histamine type (h)-receptor antagonist or a proton pump (h+,k(+)-atpase) inhibitor (proton pump inhibitor), administered in conjunction with one or more antimicrobials. also, treatment for acid-related diseases often requires extended therapy during which many concomitant medications may be administered for concurrent disease states. polypharmacy may be the result, particularly in elderly patients, who are at increased risk for both acid-related and many other diseases. thus, it is important to understand the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions in this setting. h-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors can influence the pharmacokinetic profiles of other commonly administered medications by elevating intragastric ph, which can alter drug absorption, and by interacting with the cytochrome p (cyp) enzyme system, which can affect drug metabolism and clearance. such interactions are particularly important when they affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g. warfarin, digoxin). in these cases, drug-drug interactions can result in significant toxicity and even death. there are marked differences among h-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors in their potential for such interactions. the oldest drugs in each class, cimetidine and omeprazole, respectively, have the greatest potential to alter cyp activity and change the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. the most recently developed h-receptor antagonist, famotidine, and the newer proton pump inhibitors, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, are much less likely to induce or inhibit cyp and thereby change the metabolism of other medications. these differences are important when choosing medications for the safe treatment of patients with acid-related diseases."
"lack of drug interaction between omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and theophylline. theophylline is a model substrate of cytochrome pa. the ability of the proton pump inhibitors (ppi) omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole to induce cytochrome pa has not yet been unequivocally resolved. the aim of this comprehensive study was to compare directly the effect of the three ppi on the absorption and disposition of theophylline."
"review article: rabeprazole's profile in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. the selection of agents to treat patients with acid-related gastrointestinal diseases requires knowledge of their efficacy, tolerability, and ease of dosing among individuals with differing disease severities and other baseline characteristics. the efficacy and favourable benefit-risk profile of rabeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor, has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gerd), duodenal ulcers, and gastric ulcers. in comparative trials, rabeprazole is at least as effective as omeprazole for the treatment of gerd, duodenal ulcers, and gastric ulcers, and it is superior to histamine-receptor antagonists for the treatment of gerd and duodenal ulcers. its once-daily dosing regimen and low potential for interaction with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome p system make it a particularly attractive option for the treatment of acid-related diseases among older individuals. rabeprazole is likely to be a valuable new addition to its class in treating patients with acid-related gastrointestinal diseases given its efficacy in acid suppression, high healing rates, rapid symptom relief, and convenient dosing."

increased prevalence of precancerous changes in relatives of gastric cancer patients: critical role of h. pylori. helicobacter pylori is believed to predispose to gastric cancer by inducing gastric atrophy and hypochlorhydria. first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer have an increased risk of developing gastric cancer. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of atrophy and hypochlorhydria and their association with h. pylori infection in first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer.
pantoprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer: a multicenter study in brazil. the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of pantoprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcers in the brazilian population.
"lack of interaction between lansoprazole and propranolol, a pharmacokinetic and safety assessment. due to the prevalence of both gastrointestinal and cardiovascular diseases, it is likely that patients may be coprescribed gastric parietal cell proton pump inhibitors and beta-adrenergic antagonists. therefore, the objectives of this phase i study were to assess the potential effects of the coadministration of lansoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and to evaluate the safety of propranolol with concomitant lansoprazole dosing. in a double-blind fashion, healthy male nonsmokers were initially randomized to receive either mg oral lansoprazole, each morning for days, or an identical placebo (period ). on day , all subjects were concomitantly administered oral propranolol, mg. after a minimum of week following the last dose of either lansoprazole or placebo, subjects were crossed over to the opposite treatment for another days (period ). subjects were again administered oral propranolol on day . during both treatment periods, blood samples for the determination of plasma propranolol and -hydroxy-propranolol were obtained just before the dose and at ., , , , , , , , , and hours postdose. plasma propranolol and -hydroxy-propranolol concentrations were determined by using hplc with fluorescence detection. the cmax, tmax, auc-infinity, and t/ values for propranolol, as well as the auc-infinity for -hydroxy-propranolol, were calculated and compared between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens. the mean age of the subjects who successfully completed the study was years (range: - years), and their average weight was . pounds (range: - pounds). there were no statistically significant differences between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens for the propranolol cmax, tmax, auc-infinity, and t/ values. also, there were no statistically significant differences between regimens for the -oh-propranolol auc-infinity. safety evaluations, which included adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory determinations, ecg, and physical examinations, revealed no unexpected clinically significant findings and did not suggest a drug-drug interaction. in conclusion, lansoprazole does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, suggesting that it does not interact with the cypd- or cypc-mediated metabolism of propranolol. modification of a propranolol dosage regimen in the presence of lansoprazole is not indicated, based on the pharmacokinetic analysis and the lack of a clinically significant alteration in the pharmacodynamic response."

"review article: potential gastrointestinal effects of long-term acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors. this review examines the evidence for the development of adverse effects due to prolonged gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors. potential areas of concern regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor use have included: carcinoid formation; development of gastric adenocarcinoma (especially in patients with helicobacter pylori infection); bacterial overgrowth; enteric infections; and malabsorption of fat, minerals, and vitamins. prolonged proton pump inhibitor use may lead to enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, but has not been demonstrated to increase the risk of carcinoid formation. long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment has not been documented to hasten the development or the progression of atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer, although long-term studies are required to allow definitive conclusions. at present, we do not recommend that patients be tested routinely for h. pylori infection when using proton pump inhibitors for prolonged periods. gastric bacterial overgrowth does increase with acid suppression, but important clinical sequelae, such a higher rate of gastric adenocarcinoma, have not been seen. the risk of enteric infection may increase with acid suppression, although this does not seem to be a common clinical problem with prolonged proton pump inhibitor use. the absorption of fats and minerals does not appear to be significantly impaired with chronic acid suppression. however, vitamin b concentration may be decreased when gastric acid is markedly suppressed for prolonged periods (e.g. zolllinger-ellison syndrome), and vitamin b levels should probably be assessed in patients taking high-dose proton pump inhibitors for many years. thus, current evidence suggests that prolonged gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors rarely, if ever, produces adverse events. nevertheless, continued follow-up of patients taking proton pump inhibitors for extended periods will provide greater experience regarding the potential gastrointestinal adverse effects of long-term acid suppression."

"comparative trial of pantoprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. results of a german multicenter study. in patients with acute symptomatic reflux esophagitis grade ii and iii (savary-miller classification), we compared the efficacy and safety of pantoprazole, a newly developed proton pump inhibitor given at a once-daily dose of mg, with a standard dose of the h receptor antagonist ranitidine ( mg b.i.d.) in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. complete healing was achieved after and weeks of therapy (protocol-correct) in and % (pantoprazole) and and % (ranitidine), respectively (p = . at weeks and p < . at weeks). the predominant symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, i.e., heartburn and acid eructation, were more effectively reduced in pantoprazole- than in ranitidine-treated patients. the frequency of adverse events was low and did not differ between the two treatment groups. we conclude that pantoprazole is superior to ranitidine in the acute treatment of reflux esophagitis."
"histologic patterns of omeprazole and nizatidine-healed duodenal ulcers:accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis. the mechanisms underlying duodenal ulcer (du) recurrence after endoscopically confirmed healing are unclear. we sought to examine histologic differences in healing induced by omeprazole and nizatidine. this also entailed assessing interobserver variation in endoscopic diagnosis and the correlation between endoscopic and histomorphologic healing. we treated du patients for weeks with either omeprazole ( mg daily a.m.) or nizatidine ( mg twice daily). the healing rates of both groups showed no significant differences (.% versus .%; p = .). good mucosal repair rates did not differ significantly (.% versus .% respectively; p = .). endoscopists' agreement over scar type was ., with the chance of agreement . (k = . +/- -.). the correlation between macroscopic and histologic appearance of scars was fair, but fully significant (r = .; p < .). we conclude that the study was too small to detect significant differences in healing patterns between the two drugs. the wide variation in endoscopic diagnosis suggests that mucosal repair is best assessed by histologic examination of biopsy samples."
"effects of pantoprazole on endocrine function in healthy male volunteers. in a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study, pantoprazole mg or placebo were given orally to male volunteers for weeks each. there was a wash-out period of at least week between the two treatment periods. the effects of pantoprazole or placebo on cortisol and testosterone (primary criteria), and tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin and somatotrophic hormone were compared. in addition, intragastric -h ph, -h h(+)-activity, and volume of nocturnal gastric juice were determined by gastric aspiration technique."
"comparison of serum anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium, and anti-jejunum antibodies in adult celiac sprue. we compared the diagnostic accuracy of a new immunological marker of celiac sprue (cs), the antijejunum antibody (jab), with that of antigliadin (aga) and antiendomysium (ema) antibodies. one hundred untreated adults with biopsy-proven cs, healthy controls, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease, lymphoma of the small bowel, whipple's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome were investigated. only jab and ema were detected at a similar titer in all patients with untreated cs but in no controls (% sensitivity and specificity). sensitivity of aga was, respectively, % for iga and % for ig class, with a and % specificity. the differences in frequencies between both ema and jab with iga and igg aga were highly significant. we conclude that jab and ema provide a reliable noninvasive screening test for clinically significant gluten-sensitive enteropathy. the lower cost of iga-jab is a major advantage, owing to the different availability of the lower third of the esophagus and jejunum from primates. the sensitivity and specificity of the two tests are almost identical, but we find interpreting ema easier than jab especially when the titer is low."
"a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled study of omeprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer in israel. a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study of israeli patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer is described. the study compares the efficacy (i.e., ulcer healing and relief of symptoms) and safety of mg omeprazole once daily in the morning, with those of mg ranitidine once daily at night. the omeprazole group had significantly higher cumulative healing rates than the ranitidine group both at day (% vs. %, p < .) and day (% vs. %, p < .). the efficacy was unaffected by known risk factors such as smoking. the omeprazole group had significantly fewer days with pain than the ranitidine group (median vs. . days) (p < .). there were no differences in ulcer size, symptoms or healing rates between ashkenazi and sephardic patients who were born in israel, or who had immigrated to israel. in summary, the present study confirms the efficacy and safety of omeprazole in the treatment of duodenal ulcer. omeprazole provides more rapid relief of the symptoms and heals a greater proportion of duodenal ulcers, within - weeks, than ranitidine."

"long-term consequences with regard to clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of episodic treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine for healing of duodenal ulcer. the clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of episodic treatment of duodenal ulcer with omeprazole and ranitidine were evaluated over a -year period. the analysis was based on data from published clinical trials comparing healing rates obtained with omeprazole and with ranitidine, as well as on data from the literature on ulcer recurrence and other clinical events. patients with an active duodenal ulcer were treated until healed or for a maximum of weeks. maintenance therapy was instituted in patients with ulcers that were very slow to heal and in patients with frequent relapses after cessation of treatment. patients who experienced frequent relapses while receiving maintenance therapy, and those whose ulcer had not healed after weeks of continuous treatment, were defined as candidates for surgery. a statistical model was set up and a random number generator used to generate a sequence of clinical events, month by month, over a -year period for each patient in a large cohort. episodic treatment with omeprazole was shown to be more effective in avoiding maintenance treatment and surgery when compared with episodic treatment with ranitidine. patients who received episodic treatment with omeprazole also spent more time in remission from disease. using current swedish cost data, it was found that episodic treatment with omeprazole was more cost-effective than episodic treatment with ranitidine."

"risk-benefit assessment of omeprazole in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. for the treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis, especially erosive oesophagitis, omeprazole has an advantage over histamine h-receptor antagonists because it heals significantly more patients significantly faster. adverse effects have been observed during short term treatment with the same frequency as during treatment with h-antagonists. also, maintenance treatment with omeprazole of reflux oesophagitis is significantly superior to h-antagonist therapy. during long term treatment for up to years no further drug-related adverse effects have been observed. moderate hypergastrinaemia occurs in some patients, especially if an omeprazole dosage of mg/day is needed. a slight increase of the agyrophil (endocrine) cell volume density and an extension of micronodular hyperplasia in the oxyntic mucosa after several years of omeprazole treatment seem to be related to the severity of the corpus gastritis and not to drug-induced hypergastrinaemia, because similar changes have been observed in equal frequency in patients not receiving anti-secretory drugs. theoretical arguments against long term treatment with potent acid-suppressing drugs, such as the possible consequences of gastric bacterial overgrowth or hypergastrinaemia, are not supported by clinical observations and epidemiological data and are, therefore, speculative."
"short report: treatment of gastric ulcer with lansoprazole or ranitidine: a multicentre clinical trial. we studied the effectiveness of lansoprazole and ranitidine in promoting gastric ulcer healing in a multicentre double-blind trial, by comparing the proportion of healed ulcers after and weeks of treatment. one hundred and fifty-eight patients were randomly given either ranitidine ( mg each morning and at bedtime) or lansoprazole ( mg each morning and placebo at bedtime). one hundred and twenty-eight patients completed the trial ( taking lansoprazole, taking ranitidine). fifty-one (%) of those treated with lansoprazole and forty-two (%) of those treated with ranitidine had healed ulcers at weeks (p < .). sixty-one (%) patients who received lansoprazole and (%) who received ranitidine had healed ulcers at weeks (p < .). the observed differences were not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis. no serious adverse event was reported with lansoprazole."

"omeprazole v ranitidine for prevention of relapse in reflux oesophagitis. a controlled double blind trial of their efficacy and safety. the aim of this study was to compare recurrence rates of reflux oesophagitis (after endoscopic healing with omeprazole) over a month period of randomised, double blind, maintenance treatment with either daily omeprazole ( mg every morning; n = ), weekend omeprazole ( mg on three consecutive days a week, n = ) or daily ranitidine ( mg twice daily, n = ). patients were assessed for relapse by endoscopy (with gastric biopsy) at six and months, or in the event of symptomatic recurrence, and serum gastrin was monitored. at months, the estimated proportions of patients in remission (actuarial life table method) were % when receiving daily omeprazole compared with % when receiving weekend omeprazole (difference %, p < ., % confidence intervals: % to %) and % when receiving daily ranitidine (difference %, p < ., % confidence intervals: % to %). median gastrin concentrations increased slightly during the healing phase, but remained within the normal range and did not change during maintenance treatment. no significant pathological findings were noted, and no adverse events were attributable to the study treatments. in conclusion, for patients who respond favourably to acute treatment with omeprazole mg every morning, the drug is a safe and highly effective maintenance treatment for preventing relapse of reflux oesophagitis and its associated symptoms over months. by contrast, weekend omeprazole and daily ranitidine were ineffective."
"does mg omeprazole daily offer additional benefit over mg daily in patients requiring more than weeks of treatment for symptomatic reflux oesophagitis? this study was designed to establish whether mg omeprazole once daily exhibits sufficient additional efficacy over that of mg omeprazole once daily in patients with symptomatic reflux oesophagitis requiring more than an initial -week course of mg omeprazole once daily (o.m.) to warrant routine use of the higher dose. three hundred and thirteen patients were randomized to receive either mg omeprazole ( weeks) then mg (second weeks if not both healed and symptom-free after weeks), or mg omeprazole ( weeks) then mg omeprazole o.m. (second weeks). one hundred and twenty-seven patients were healed and symptom-free after weeks and left the study at that point. taking the second treatment period in isolation, the healing rate (% vs. %, p < .) and relief of heartburn (% vs. %, p < .) were greater among patients receiving mg omeprazole o.m., demonstrating the existence of a dose-response relationship for omeprazole. however, on completion, there were no significant differences between the patients randomized to the / mg (healed %, asymptomatic %) or the / mg (healed %, asymptomatic %: both not significant differences compared with / mg) regimens. the magnitude of the difference in efficacy between and mg omeprazole in symptomatic reflux oesophagitis is insufficient to warrant the routine use of mg in patients requiring more than weeks' treatment with mg omeprazole o.m.; continued treatment with mg omeprazole for - weeks is the preferred option."
"omeprazole and high dose ranitidine in the treatment of refractory reflux oesophagitis. thirty two consecutive patients (age range months-. years) with severe reflux oesophagitis were randomised to a therapeutic trial for eight weeks during which they received either standard doses of omeprazole ( mg/day/. m surface area) or high doses of ranitidine ( mg/kg/day). twenty five patients completed the trial ( on omeprazole, on ranitidine). at entry and at the end of the trial patients underwent symptomatic score assessment, endoscopic and histological evaluation of the oesophagus, and simultaneous oesophageal and gastric ph measurement; results are given as median (range). both therapeutic regimens were effective in decreasing clinical score (omeprazole before . (-), after . (-); ranitidine before . (-), after . (-)), in improving the histological degree of oesophagitis (omeprazole before . (-), after . (-); ranitidine before . (-), after .

(-)) as well as intragastric acidity, measured as median intragastric ph (omeprazole before . (.-.), after . (.-.); ranitidine before . (.-), after . (.-.)). serum gastrin concentration was > ng/l in four patients on omeprazole and in three patients on ranitidine. it is concluded that in children with refractory reflux oesophagitis high doses of ranitidine are comparable with omeprazole for the healing of oesophagitis and relief of symptoms; both drugs resulted in efficacious reduction of intragastric acidity and intra-oesophageal acid exposure."
"review article: the continuing development of proton pump inhibitors with particular reference to pantoprazole. inhibition of the gastric proton pump is gaining acceptance as the treatment of choice for severe gastrooesophageal reflux disease, and for treatment of duodenal and gastric ulceration. three of these drugs are now available (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) and more are being developed. proton pump inhibitors share the same core structure, but differ in terms of substituents on this core. the substitutions are able to modify some important chemical properties of the compounds. for example, pantoprazole is significantly more acid-stable than omeprazole or lansoprazole. e is significantly less stable than the other compounds. we present an explantation for this finding that depends on the relative pk values for the pyridine and benzimidazole nitrogens, especially the former. pantoprazole formulated in an enteric-coated tablet displays high bioavailability and linear pharmacokinetics whether on single or multiple dose regimens. although all three proton pump inhibitors provide a similar chemical conversion to sulphenamides, which are highly reactive cysteine reagents, these reagents derivatize different cysteines in the extracytoplasmic or membrane domain of the pump and inhibit the pump at different rates. whereas the differences in chemical reactivity can be explained by the solution chemistry of the compounds, selective derivatization of different cysteines on the protein argues for an involvement of pump structure in response to the presence of the proton pump inhibitor on its luminal surface. this suggests that the proton pump inhibitors, which were originally designed to take advantage of only the highly acidic space generated in the parietal cell by the production of the sulphenamide, are made even more selective by the protein they target. pantoprazole is metabolized by a combination of phase i and phase ii metabolism, and has also been shown to have a very low potential for drug interaction. studies of acid secretion in man have shown this compound to be an effective and long lasting inhibitor of acid secretion. the pharmacodynamics explain the cumulative effect of repeated doses and maximal acid secretory capacity with a once daily dosage."

"a cost-effective approach to the patient with peptic ulcer bleeding. the average hospital cost to manage patients hospitalized at virginia mason hospital who bleed from a peptic ulcer is approximately $ per patient in our series of patients. because there are , admissions per year in the united states for peptic ulcer bleeding, the total hospital cost can be estimated to be $ million. the actual cost may be higher because our patients had minimal complications and were discharged on average in less than days. the majority of hospital cost is incurred by the intensive care unit or the hospital nursing floor. there is a close to linear relation between the length of stay and the total hospital cost. upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a major advance in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. it can provide significant cost savings by identifying some patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who have clean bases on endoscopy who are then eligible for prompt discharge from the hospital. in addition, endoscopic thermal therapy (with multipolar electrocautery or heater probe) and injection therapy cost less than $ in incremental cost and can reduce further bleeding by %, reduce the need for urgent surgery by %, and reduce the mortality rate by %. some patients still require urgent surgical intervention, which is substantially more costly than endoscopic hemostasis but is highly effective. preliminary studies show promise in predicting further bleeding, with clinical scoring systems such as the baylor bleeding score and with the use of doppler ultrasonography. better prediction of further bleeding should guide the choice of durable hemostasis early in the hospitalization. additional studies should clarify the role of nsaid avoidance and h. pylori eradication in the long-term prevention of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding."
"cost of acid peptic disorders in a managed-care organization. the purpose of this study was to determine the cost of managing ambulatory patients with symptoms of acid peptic disorders in a managed-care organization under actual clinical conditions. study data were collected in a large independent practice association model health maintenance organization in gainesville, florida, from prescription records maintained in a computerized database and from patient medical records. patients had to be started on a histamine-receptor antagonist (hra) or the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole between and . a total of patients qualified for inclusion in the study; received hras, received omeprazole, and received combination therapy. the costs of procedures, physician visits, and drug therapy were considered in the economic evaluation. costs were evaluated using two methods: the capitation total cost (ctc) and the fee-for-service total cost (fstc). the mean ctc and fstc for managing a patient with acid peptic symptoms for months were $ +/- (range, $ to $) and $ +/- (range, $ to $), respectively. drug costs represented % of the total fstc and % of the total ctc. drug costs were followed by the costs for encounters with primary care physicians, endoscopy, referral to specialists, and upper gastrointestinal (ugi) tract procedures. documented outcomes were available for patients. compared with patients receiving hras (n = ), patients receiving omeprazole (n = ) had significantly lower fstcs ($ +/- compared with $ +/- , respectively); diagnostic testing costs (for endoscopy, $ compared with $ +/- , respectively; for ugi procedures, $ +/- compared with $ +/- , respectively); physician encounter costs ($ +/- compared with $ +/- , respectively); and referral to specialist costs ($ compared with $ +/- , respectively). patients receiving omeprazole also had more positive clinical outcomes than patients receiving hras (% compared with %, respectively), resulting in a more favorable cost of producing a successful outcome compared with patients receiving an hra. the cost of success was $ for patients treated with omeprazole compared with $ for patients treated with hras. the findings of this analysis conducted under actual clinical conditions support findings of randomized clinical trials showing the cost-effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors."

"gastric acid, acid-suppressing drugs, and bacterial gastroenteritis: how much of a risk? recent studies have reported an association between acid-suppressing drugs (histamine h receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) and development of infectious gastroenteritis. we conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of more than , ever-users of acid-suppressing drugs to examine the association between acid-suppressing drugs and bacterial gastroenteritis, using data from the general practice research database in the united kingdom. we identified confirmed cases of bacterial gastroenteritis and , randomly sampled controls from the study cohort. there was little increased risk of bacterial gastroenteritis among users of acid-suppressing drugs [relative risk (rr) = .; % confidence interval (ci) = .-.]. omeprazole ""single users"" had an rr of . (% ci = .-.), but this effect was not observed among those using only omeprazole during the last year (rr = .; % ci = .-.). we did not find any dose or treatment duration response. these data do not support a major role for acid reduction in the development of bacterial gastroenteritis."
"enantioselective hydroxylation of omeprazole catalyzed by cypc in swedish white subjects. stereoselective disposition of omeprazole and its formed -hydroxy metabolite were studied in five poor metabolizers and five extensive metabolizers of s-mephenytoin. after a single oral dose of omeprazole ( mg), the plasma concentrations of the separate enantiomers of the parent drug and the -hydroxy metabolite were determined for hours after drug intake. in poor metabolizers, the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [auc(-)] of (+)-omeprazole was larger and that of the -hydroxy metabolite of this enantiomer was smaller than the auc(-) values in extensive metabolizers (p < .). the mean auc(-) of the (-)-enantiomer of omeprazole was also higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, but only .-fold compared with .-fold for (+)-omeprazole. the rate of formation of the hydroxy metabolite from (-)-omeprazole was low and not significantly different in poor and extensive metabolizers. these results show that (+)-omeprazole is to a major extent hydroxylated by cypc. also (-)-omeprazole may partly be metabolized by this enzyme but is mainly metabolized by another enzyme, presumably cypa, to the achiral sulfone metabolite. the plasma concentration ratio of omeprazole to -hydroxyomeprazole obtained hours after the drug intake has been used to distinguish between extensive and poor metabolizer phenotypes. with use of the ratio between the (+)-enantiomers of the parent drug and the metabolite, a better discrimination between phenotypes was obtained. the ratio between the (-)-enantiomers also separated the phenotypes but was less discriminatory. for the future, measurement of total concentrations will suffice for phenotyping."

influence of clarithromycin dosage on pantoprazole combined triple therapy for eradication of helicobacter pylori. low-dose clarithromycin ( mg b.d.) in combination with omeprazole and metronidazole has been recommended for the eradication of helicobacter pylori. whether the substitution of omeprazole by pantoprazole requires adjustment of the clarithromycin dose is not known.
"effect of omeprazole treatment on plasma concentrations of the gastric peptides, xenin, gastrin and somatostatin, and of pepsinogen. the peptide xenin is a gastric mucosal constituent like gastrin, somatostatin and pepsinogen. gastrin and pepsinogen plasma concentrations increase when the secretion of gastric acid is reduced by proton pump inhibitors. in the present investigation, treatment with omeprazole led to an increase in fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of xenin, gastrin and pepsinogens a and c (p < ., in each instance), whereas somatostatin plasma levels remained unchanged. because subcutaneous injection of pentagastrin did not raise xenin plasma concentrations, a direct effect of gastrin on xenin production seems unlikely. this study indicates that xenin plasma concentrations are regulated by intragastric ph, as are those of gastrin and pepsinogen."

"omeprazole. a review of its use in helicobacter pylori infection, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. omeprazole is a well studied proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion. this review examines its use in helicobacter pylori infection, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) with or without oesophagitis and gastrointestinal damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). optimal omeprazole regimens for anti-h. pylori therapy are those that administer the drug at a dosage of mg/day (in or divided doses) for , or days in combination with antibacterial agents. as a component of -drug regimens in direct comparative studies, omeprazole was at least as effective as lansoprazole, pantoprazole, bismuth compounds and ranitidine. however, a meta-analysis suggests that triple therapies with omeprazole are more effective than comparable regimens containing ranitidine, lansoprazole or bismuth. omeprazole also appears to be successful in triple therapy regimens used in children with h. pylori infection. in patients with acute gord with oesophagitis, omeprazole is at least as effective as lansoprazole or pantoprazole in promoting healing, and superior to ranitidine, cimetidine or cisapride in oesophagitis healing and symptom relief. omeprazole was similar to lansoprazole and superior to ranitidine in preventing oesophagitis relapse in patients with all grades of oesophagitis, but may be superior to lansoprazole or pantoprazole in patients with more severe disease. more patients with symptomatic gord without oesophagitis experienced symptom relief after short term treatment with omeprazole than with ranitidine, cisapride or placebo, and symptoms were more readily prevented by omeprazole than by cimetidine or placebo. omeprazole was effective in healing and relieving symptoms of reflux oesophagitis in children with oesophagitis refractory to histamine h receptor antagonists. omeprazole is superior to placebo in preventing nsaid-induced gastrointestinal damage in patients who must continue to take nsaids. it is also similar to misoprostol and superior to ranitidine in its ability to heal nsaid-induced peptic ulcers and erosions, and superior to misoprostol, ranitidine or placebo in its ability to prevent relapse. in long and short term studies, omeprazole was well tolerated, with diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, flatulence, abdominal pain and constipation being the most commonly reported adverse events. usual omeprazole dosages, alone or combined with other agents, are to mg/day for adults and to mg/day for children."
"lansoprazole and omeprazole in the prevention of relapse of reflux oesophagitis: a long-term comparative study. proton pump inhibitors are superior to h-receptor antagonists in the prevention of relapse of oesophagitis, but few data directly compare the relative efficacies of lansoprazole and omeprazole in preventing oesophagitis relapse over a prolonged period."
